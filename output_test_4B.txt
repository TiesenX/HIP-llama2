The serene landscape of the countryside was dotted with spots of delightful and attractive shops. After passing through the twin villages of Chenean-la-Arriere and Chenean-sur-Seul, we arrived at the site of our first stay – the Lunay Castle. This is where we first got the idea for the tour of Lunay; an exquisite property full of history that was built in the XVI century by one of the most renowned and illustrious French artists of the period, Jean Baptiste-Joseph Baumay.
From the castle, we drove through the heart of Arudes, just the opposite of Lunay, to visit Lunay Manor. The property consists of a manor house, a beautiful temple, as well as a walled garden with an archery court. The castle was built by Jean Baptiste-Joseph Baumay in 1605; he had this property built in the middle of a moated estate, in the heart of one of the foremost duchy of Languedoc. Originally he built a new castle for his son and grew a tree of immense splendor. In this site, Baumay also designed the Temple of Saint Ardent. The temple is situated in the middle of a pond, alongside the grotto, the Orangery and the Tunnel of Love.
In the outdoor park, a massive square is surrounded by 200 roses, as well as statues and a flower bed. The atmosphere is slightly more relaxed at this more intimate square. During our stay, we wandered through the park, while the children enjoyed themselves at the toy truck.
Next stop: Val-Jourdain (Palu). During the Renaissance, Val-Jourdain had the advantage of being the strongest city in the region. The first settlements date back to 550 BC, and it became an important trading centre. It was a stronghold of the Languedoc Kingdom during the 11th century.
Located next to Orangery, the Fortress, we drove into this fortified outpost. Built in the XIV century, its arches are round and its interior features some beautiful staircases. The prison had the role of keeping the English prisoners in the castle and, most importantly, of holding the commander for being one of the 4 main pillars of the Languedoc Crusades.
After a short break, we stopped at the Hotel des Pats. It is set around a large pond, surrounded by fountains and shrubs. There is a small swimming pool, perfect for relaxing in the sun with a good book. For the kids, there is a funfair with pendulums, a sailing boat, a paddling pool and a large trampoline.
During our tour, we visited the Poor House and the two orphanages, including the home for widows and small children. This allows us to go back into our stay at the Manor.
Later on in the day, we had a visit to Lunay Castle. From there we drove back through the valley to Lunay and Les Plages.
Then it was time to make our way back to Arudes.
Thank you to the Lunay Manor, and our numerous tour guides, who were always helpful and keen to make our stay in Lunay as memorable as possible. We highly recommend a stay in Lunay to all our guests who want to see more of the south of France.

In the depths of the ancient forest, there was a moment when the mighty Mother of the forest cracked her head in agony, howling with rage, unable to find strength anymore, unable to feel the forest so strong. In the midst of the roar she threw her hands high, up and away from the wall of flame. The twisted root clutched the rhizomes, the massive leaves; everything was pushed away, the walls thrown high and out of the way, the mighty Mother of the forest, like a broken glass, was tossed into the river, where, like a reflection in the water, she stood still and without moveability. Nothing is possible anymore. Mother Death is here, slamming on the door, and inside her the great forest burns.

The whispered legends of the haunted mansion spoke of uninvited guests, terrorized guests, whispers in the parlor, and spooky sounds in the parlor. Because she needed a break from her boredom, Miss Davenport took the plunge and decided to “try the Terror Room.” After a very short investigation, Miss Davenport concluded that she might be cured of her illness if she could capture the ghost of Annie Hackett.
Little did she know that the Terror Room was just the beginning of her adventure. When she descended into the basement, she was shocked to discover what to her own dismay, she discovered all the doors and crevices leading to the Terror Room had been covered with what appeared to be blotchy, white spots. When she turned to look at the floor, she saw what appeared to be a disturbance: the footsteps of a little girl, faintly audible.
The next thing she heard was “Hello?” Miss Davenport calmly replied and the young girl’s shouts sounded to the girl and to her like a spooky trance. When she looked away, she saw she had been too closely connected to the Terror Room and seemed to have fallen into a coma.
Another spooky mansion happened and in the next 24 hours, the ghost of Annie Hackett became known in this place. The ghost is still haunted around the mansion even now but when she leaves, she is unable to feel the presence of a soul until she has looked at it for a few minutes at a time.
The ghost of Annie Hackett still lingers around the mansion as if being in her own body while Annie Hackett and her ghost are there in different parts of the mansion. This haunting is not only an eerie story but also has its history behind it. The mansion itself was built in 1888 by F.L. Davenport, Sr., a wealthy Virginia merchant.
Initially the mansion was meant to be the home of his son Frank A. Davenport, who was an attorney. It also became the home of his daughter Marion G. Davenport and her daughter Jean F. Hackett, who were both born and raised here. In 1901, during the First World War, Frank A. Davenport Sr. served with the Cavalry in the American Expeditionary Force.
After the war was over, the home returned to the Davenport family, the former owners, and in 1915, Mrs. Louis Davenport died and the Davenport family, she was buried in an unmarked grave in the mansion. When her daughter Jean passed away in 1919, her body was interred at her parents’ home in Vienna, Virginia.
At that time, the house was in the process of being renovated by her nieces, the widows of Edward P. “Ginger” Brandon and Elizabeth “Gingy” McMahan, and their nieces, Mrs. McMahan and Mrs. Davenport. When the Brandon’s were in New York City, they found the house in disrepair and in the middle of renovation. They offered the mansion as their own home while they built the house of their daughter, Mary, and her husband, Alonzo, in Arlington, Virginia.
Soon the renovated mansion was adopted by Miss Gingy McMahan, and Mary Brandon. In 1919, Ginger and Elizabeth McMahan were put in charge of the house.
From this time on, Miss McMahan found the house unfinished, looted and deteriorated. She knew that the rooms had been filled with the materials that could be used to make the first floor of the mansion. When the mansion was renovated, some of the unfinished parts of the mansion were used for the floors. However, the ghost was never seen in the original room until years later. In the 1920s, when the house was nearly rebuilt again, Ginger McMahan learned that the house was full of ghosts.
Miss Gingy McMahan recalled that the area where the ghosts were was originally used for sitting rooms and living rooms. The original room was filled with furniture and walls which had been used as a sitting room in the house. This had then been filled with furniture and walls. One of the sitting rooms that existed was for sitting on an old sofa which had been reused to cover one of the hallways.
The room that had been used to sit on the old sofa was believed to be the same room where the ghost now haunts.
The ghost had several appearances to the McMahans. During their last nights in the room, the ghost was sometimes seen grabbing at Mary McMahan’s shoulder. After the ghost disappears, the McMahans felt that the room was now used to sleep and that they were now protected from evil. The ghost, on the other hand, seems to relish their trials and torments.
The other rooms of the house which is now known as the “Terror Room” are now part of the “Others” Room. This room has a very eerie and “being there” feeling to it. This is as though a ghost is there in the room. The sense of being there has only been experienced by Miss Davenport.
Also, Miss Davenport’s investigations around the house have discovered a big time ring in her time. The “Terror Room” is now where the ring was kept until someone took a photo of the ring on the door of the room.
“It was just a very eerie feeling. I just couldn’t believe my life. It’s just like a feeling that you get from being there and the other-worldliness. I can still hear the girl’s voice, but I can’t feel anything. The girl’s voice was there but it just wasn’t herself. It was just like a ghost in the room, but this woman was trying to coerce me into leaving. I wasn’t letting go of the boy and I was screaming, screaming…” (Hackett).
It seems that Miss Davenport was involved in researching and working on the true origins of the ghosts and events that have taken place in the mansion. She had her own findings and has her own ideas and opinions on what has happened in the mansion, although most of them are unsubstantiated by her. Some have even tried to purchase the mansion but have been denied.
There is little that is known about the events that have happened in the Terror Room or the other parts of the house. There was a much-believed maze in the basement and a gate that opened every day at 10:00pm. A full-time guard was supposed to guard the door and the other guards were supposed to go out the basement at 10:00pm so that the ghost had a chance to lure the ghost. However, there was no way to prove this theory.
The death of F.L. Davenport has brought a lot of pressure from his relatives and in recent years, they have all been trying to find answers. In one of the stories, Davenport is said to have died during the Spanish flu pandemic. His death, which was supposedly from a heart attack, has caused all of his relatives to try and find a connection with the Terror Room.
The only thing that can be proven for sure is that Miss Davenport has been in the room many times and experienced strange experiences which she believed to be the ghosts and activity in the room.

At the annual robot parade, a quirky invention goes hilariously awry, causing chaos at an airport
Rachel Michaelson, 41, who used to work as a dentist in Ohio and helped coach a robot team, and Jason Vick, 35, a car salesman, worked the event with Ricky and his assistant, Grace. “We found out a couple of weeks before, but because it was a small group of us, everyone was excited,” she says. “The whole event was amazing.”
Ricky and Grace at the airport parade
The robot, a jet ski rider, takes off and the pilots get excited and frisky. Just before takeoff, Grace shouted, “Have fun, and good luck!”
Jason and Rachel took the jet skiers to safety.
“When they took them off, they were like, ‘Oh my gosh, they’re all weirdly attached to each other,'” says Grace. “But we had to keep the jet skiers still. They were really excited. Jason and I put them back together and we figured we had them safely stowed and took them to the gate.”
Audrey tries to take over the jet ski for Ricky
This robot is actually a jet ski, designed for events like this. The jet ski is small and fits in the container. Ricky made sure to stick the tow rope on the tow bar, to prevent it from blowing out.
“The rope was important for the jet ski not blowing out,” says Ricky. “I felt like it was necessary for Ricky to stop, so we had to be pretty precise with it.”
Ricky and Grace work on a jet ski.
Ricky and Rachel say, “I don’t want people to go through my jet ski. I’ve heard about jet skis blowing out and I was like, ‘That’s the worst thing you could possibly do,’ but then I had that experience and realized that I didn’t want anyone to get hurt.”
Ricky admits that he wanted people to go through it. He says the jet ski was a small, useful toy to display at the festival.
Jason, who had never flown on a jet ski, says he liked it.
“I felt like we’d get really excited and start talking about it,” says Jason. “We were like, ‘What can I do with it? How can I use it?'”
Grace wipes Jason’s jet ski off.
Grace says, “It was more of a fun accident to me. I didn’t plan it, and I wasn’t planning on it. It was one of those things where I had a lot of fun with it, so I just wanted to make sure that we got everyone home.”
“It was a bunch of funny people,” says Rachel. “We had one security guard who tried to take them out of the parking lot. It was crazy.”
The guys were really excited, and even laughing at times, as Ricky and Rachel brought them safely back to the airport.
Having fun with an old jet ski.
Ricky and Rachel found themselves in the eye of the storm at the airport
Sometimes it’s difficult to see through all the chaos.
“It was definitely funny,” says Rachel. “When I think back on it, I actually got a little emotional. We were so excited. It was a crazy situation. It just got a little chaotic.”
Jason and Rachel became fast friends after this night.
“We had so much fun together,” says Rachel. “We shared jokes and had a lot of laughs, and we got to know each other, but we were also good friends.”
“Everyone was laughing,” says Ricky. “It was funny.”
Jason jokes that the little jet ski was popular with the security guards on the airport grounds.
“The first time we got it, the security guard just said, ‘Just don’t put it anywhere else,’ and then I forgot about it and got on it,” says Ricky.
Ricky bought a new, repurposed jet ski to replace the first one he took apart and ruined. He still talks about it, and is worried about the next time he takes it apart.
Ricky and Grace take an airplane ride.
Ricky’s worst jet ski mishap was the one he took apart. He took the quadcopter and he tried to fly it himself. He’s joking that he’s never flown anything like this before. He has never had the courage to try it.
“I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh, no, I’m going to get hurt,” says Ricky. “It’s really dangerous.”
He thought about it for about five seconds, and then he decided to fly.
Ricky and Rachel were on a helicopter when they got scared.
“We got really lucky,” says Ricky. “It wasn’t a moment that we thought ‘I’m really scared. I’m going to get hurt,’ but I was thinking, ‘Okay, it’s not a helicopter.'”
Ricky didn’t make it to the end of the journey. He didn’t seem to have the strength to keep up with his quadcopter.
“It got really close to the helipad,” says Ricky. “I remember thinking, ‘Okay, I need to be careful.'”
He was too scared, and he tried to pump the gas on the jet ski, but nothing worked.
“I thought the most important thing was to get us to safety,” says Ricky. “I felt like it was my responsibility to do that.”
Ricky asks, “Would we have taken it off if it had come too close to the helipad?”
Ricky says, “We had to focus and think fast, because we were so scared.”
He had a helmet on the helipad.
Ricky tried to make it through the airport, but ended up on a helipad.
“We were really lucky,” says Ricky. “We were so scared, but we did what we could, and I did all I could to get us to safety. It was my job.”
A funny thing happened when the helipad rescue parachutes landed.
“It landed in a pretty soft spot, and Ricky said he was going to come get us. I just went in and was like, ‘I’m going to try to get a really good shot of this helipad.'”
Ricky tried to jump up the parachute, but he had a contraction of pain that he couldn’t do it.
“I didn’t have a taser or anything, so it was a pretty bad pain,” says Ricky. “It’s scary to hear that word, but I do it every day. I feel like a badass sometimes, and I’m proud of how I did it. I’m glad I did it.”
Ricky is excited about the next step of his project.
“I’m going to get a life jacket,” says Ricky. “That’s what I was thinking about when I was talking to Jason about it. I’m excited for that next phase.”
“That was really fun,” says Ricky. “That’s the only thing that I’ve ever really enjoyed about building things. It’s the working. It’s the nerdy, creative part.”
This was a fun toy for a festival and airport
Jason and Grace say this was the only night they didn’t have a jet ski.
“We had the jet ski, and then that night we had the jet ski and our jet ski got to be a giant toy,” says Rachel. “We were just like, ‘We love it.’
“I don’t know if I can explain why. I feel like this is really important for us, and it’s something that I love doing.”
The quadcopter was a hit at the festival, and everyone wanted to be a part of it.
“I like making things, so it was fun,” says Ricky. “We like it because it’s fun and we can make cool things with it.”
They were there a lot, but everyone’s not so sure.
“We’re going to give it to the police if we get caught,” says Rachel.
The team met the police at the end of the parade.
“We gave them a bouquet of roses, and we were like, ‘Sorry we got caught, but we hope you’re okay,'” says Rachel.
“They were like, ‘Are you sure you’re okay?'” says Jason.
“I was like, ‘I’m just going to say it, and I’m just not going to say it.'”
“I was just going to say it and that was it,” says Rachel.
Ricky says it was weird. He thought it was funny, but he also thought it was strange.
“It was just one of those things where I had a really big smile on my face,” says Jason. “But there was a lot of confusion. I’m still not sure if they meant it as a joke or if they were just confused.”
The team planned on presenting their materials at the airport as an incentive for the police.
“We just did it the easy way,” says Jason. “We showed up with two flowers, and we held each other’s hands.
“When the police officers saw us, they were like, ‘These people are creative,’ and they were like, ‘It’s a funny way to show us the way to do this.'”
They also said, “You don’t have to be a psychologist to help people. You don’t have to know how to write, but you do. Help people and be creative.”
“It was kind of a joke,” says Rachel. “It wasn’t like, ‘We’re going to present our work to the police officers, and they’re going to laugh, and we’re going to try to make fun of it and have fun.'”
“I wasn’t worried about it,” says Jason.
Rachel is thinking about adding new things to her jet ski.
“I’m going to get some lights on it and add some things to it,” says Rachel. “It’s a really cool little thing.”
This was the first robot parade that Jessica drove.
“I really like flying. It’s really fun,” says Jessica. “It’s really exciting to see them flying and watching them. It’s pretty interesting.”
A robot parade at the airport
Jessica says she’s been involved in a lot of parade things in the past, but this was the first time she’s helped the jets fly.
She didn’t like the way it ended, but it was worth it.
“I was like, ‘Well, they’re going to like this,'” says Jessica. “They’re going to like it, and I’m going to enjoy it.'”
“They’re pretty amazing,” says Jason. “They’re really quick, and they’re really, really fun. It’s a really fun thing to watch.”
The robot is pretty cool

This is the first photo shoot I did for the magazine.
I’m not happy with this pic
This is one of the first times I was asked to be a part of a photo shoot, and I was pretty excited. I like doing the magic touch. I like the lighting. I like the camera, but it’s also pretty nerve-wracking to be in front of the camera.
It’s not an easy thing to do.
I was nervous and I’d have liked to be more comfortable with the photo shoot.

During a midnight snack, someone discovers their fridge has become a portal to another universe, with the ability to transport people and spend time with their relatives and friends. That's just the beginning.

In a world where books can alter reality, a forgotten tome in an old bookstore can hold all the answers. No matter how you dive into a historical text, there are some things you can never grasp without an "unsurprising" guidebook, a handy guide to the history of a single topic. And whatever the title may be, there's nothing more confusing than digging through old tomes in need of translating, only to find them poorly dressed and unreadable in a dank, dark corner. But in the 1980s, this very problem plagued a local college library when it was taken over by a dedicated librarian and expanded collection from the lands it once held. Lined with old, ignored tomes in need of a new chapter? The librarian of the past that you seek is in the attic. He's been there for years, and he knows the history of the topics in every single book. This "How to" Manual for researchers, students, and curious historians allows them to take on the books within the library itself, getting an unsurpassed degree of access that no subject or research can match.
Human curiosity is something that drives stories, and when interest is sparked with something new, it's impossible not to pick up a book and read. The thirst for knowledge and artistic development that caused the stories that have formed this world and shaped its history are always filled with interesting topics and worlds. This book offers the reader a simple understanding of how to source what a historian needs, and how to pick up books that are hidden beneath old overstuffed tomes in a library, enabling the reader to find the true story of their source material. It is for those readers who don't get the background on how certain parts of history get lost or forgotten, and for those readers who just need to learn more about history and the places they've read about. The book is available on Amazon.com and the book can also be found at the local library.

At a secret society of time travelers, a newcomer accidentally sets the destination to the present day, and must decide if he is making the best decision ever or the worst decision of his life.

Seems like every summer, there’s a Hollywood blockbuster I’m either really looking forward to or mildly curious about. Usually the latter case, but this year things are a little different.

With the new year just around the corner, I wanted to look back at the year I saw most films from the folks at Movieweeks.com. All of these titles were released in 2016, but a few are earlier than this year.
For my yearly look at the best of the year, I usually pick a few films, so with the release of Avengers: Infinity War, it’s time to start looking at my five favourite films from 2016.
If you’re one of those parents who happens to send your kids to summer camp, it may be tough to put them in the driving seat of the school bus. With the summer school vacations all about having fun, not getting into trouble and having the best time in the history of childhood, sometimes it’s nice to just sit back and let your kid take control. But as soon as the school year starts, you can end up being on your wicket as the bad behavior starts to happen. Or maybe you just lose track of what your child is up to.

One of the most memorable things about the Marvel Cinematic Universe was the stunning comic book adaptation that was the 2008 Iron Man. The movie was released and served as a powerful commentary on the medium of superhero films and the state of the modern comic book cinema.
Superman Returns had been released in 2005, but hadn’t quite gotten the attention it deserved. At this point, DC was still publishing Superman comics. With Man of Steel, they were back at full swing. As the villainous Lex Luthor is able to infect millions of people with his evil, Man of Steel seemed like a natural pick to give the antithesis of Superman a chance. It wasn’t an easy feat, but it worked. It was released in 2013 to mixed reviews, but certainly had the impact the filmmakers had hoped.
Because it’s the ninth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the ninth instalment of Iron Man is by no means a new chapter, but one that marks a return to form.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi is sure to do the job of the original.
As the sequel to Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens is slated to release this year, moviegoers have been pining for the first film in the new trilogy. So far the response has been lukewarm. However, The Last Jedi could very well be the film of the year.
Star Trek: Discovery, the next Star Trek series is far from perfect. In fact, it’s pretty dreadful. However, I’d definitely say it’s better than the horrifying other Sci-fi series that ended after only four seasons.

The only reason people aren’t bouncing on the moon right now is because it wouldn’t be right without Michael Stahlberg. The first season of Stahlberg Falls followed a prolific job as a professional hockey player who ends up working at a shoe shop. However, just when he thinks the day has come to end it’s time to go home, he gets told he has to go on a job interview with the father of a new girl he falls for. Stahlberg Falls was a nice attempt at a cheesy dramedy, and it was nice for Michael Stahlberg to be playing a normal guy who is super kind and totally awesome.

The Good Wife, the first season of the Criminal Minds spin-off series is back for more brainy police work and the show’s characters are still the best in the field.
Finally, an extravagant space opera that has somehow escaped the diehard fans. If you’re a sci-fi lover you must see Star Wars: The Force Awakens. If you’re not then you probably should avoid the film. But whether you’re a sci-fi fan or not, you’ll definitely want to check out the other bits of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
The Rise of Skywalker, the final instalment in the second trilogy that began with Star Wars: A New Hope, is back to being an unnecessary string of titillating scenes to fill the running time of the Force Awakens. It also throws into the mix character arcs that had been considered non-existent. And while we’re already beginning to see the first hints of Clone Wars canon running amok, it’s easy to imagine that this movie could’ve been any number of the hundreds of films that have been made.

Movies, Really Watched

With two decades of comic-book movie franchises at its disposal, DC has a few tricks up its sleeve. And few are quite as good as Superman: Man of Tomorrow.
With the rise of the Marvel cinematic universe, the danger of being boring has been eradicated. So in my opinion, it’s only fair to compare Superman: Man of Tomorrow to some of Marvel’s other films. While they might not have been nearly as good, they did offer some amazing additions to the superhero genre. With a brand new story and new take on the character, we’re expecting this movie to live up to its title.

It’s always great to see a movie franchise get rebooted with a fresh start, especially when it comes to the characters from one of the biggest franchises of all time. With John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum due out next year, it’s certainly safe to say that Keanu Reeves will be in fine form.

Alden Ehrenreich was going to be a bad-ass secret agent, but he was a bad-ass secret agent. He was a little bit of a loner, and he wanted more freedom. So he betrayed his country. He betrayed his best friend, his family, and even his boss. He betrayed all of his comrades, too. Alden Ehrenreich wasn’t perfect. He was not always well liked. He did everything he could to prove that he was not a spy. He didn’t know if he wanted to be a spy. He just wanted to save the day.
Supergirl, the DC superhero show that has been teased for a long time, makes her debut on the CW. With so many female-focused superhero shows, this show feels different. As she begins her first day on the job, Supergirl faces not only great danger but also the threat of being sidelined by the president.
