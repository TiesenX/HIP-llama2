An alien visiting Earth for the first time becomes obsessed with knitting, eventually starting a pet shop with his friend to get a good round of mates and creating a big kit for the local store that turns out well-done.
Through flashbacks and memories, we learn more about his life, much of which seems to be forgotten by him as he finds himself preparing to fly off to Earth alone. Along the way, he forms relationships with staff at the store, attempting to explain to them what he does and how he does it.
In the end, we learn a lot about his personality and end up with an understanding of his story, his emotions, his intellect, his bonds with people. Although the ending of this story doesn't really go anywhere (spoiler alert!), it is actually a breath of fresh air and it doesn't have the overwhelming sense of false hope that many other KNITTERS OF KINDRED WIND drops do.
This is a pretty short read, being around 2500-3000 words. It's supposed to be a speculative futuristic fantasy story, but the sort of speculative that even I would like. The characters are decent and interesting, and the descriptions vividly show the environment, the technology, the social environment, and human relationships. The fantasy element works well and adds a good sense of drama.
I had some problems with this, mostly with the ending. It's actually better than I thought, in spite of the big twist. However, as I said, there are people who might want to reread it. They'll get a better sense of the story, even if they never knew that it had a second plotline (which, again, goes really far beyond anything that could be described as a twist in a science fiction story).

In the depths of the ancient forest, there was a moment when the mighty Mother of the forest cracked her head in agony, howling with rage, unable to find strength anymore, unable to feel the forest so strong. In the midst of the roar she threw her hands high, up and away from the wall of flame. The twisted root clutched the rhizomes, the massive leaves; everything was pushed away, the walls thrown high and out of the way, the mighty Mother of the forest, like a broken glass, was tossed into the river, where, like a reflection in the water, she stood still and without moveability. Nothing is possible anymore. Mother Death is here, slamming on the door, and inside her the great forest burns.

In the early hours of the morning, the truck full of our stuff stopped in front of me. This was back in 2007. I went on my 6 mile trip from my apartment in Seoul to go to the Korean Airbnb’s. It would be 6 years before I could get on a flight to Vietnam. This time, I didn’t think twice. I told the security that I just wanted to go home for a while and I would be right back. I had to go to the airport in Seoul to get my flight to Saigon. I don’t remember how I got back home from that crazy street fair in Seoul, the last time I used the metro. I think I have found a way to travel back home without relying on the metro or subway or the train.
I had to go to the airport in Seoul and purchase my flight ticket from Korea. I went in a few minutes after I got back to the hotel. Then I went to the airport gate and I stood in the hot sun for hours looking at plane tickets. 4 hours passed and I was not ready for the long flight ahead of me. I must have been lucky that the Korean Airbnb was vacant for a few hours before I could get back on the plane. We were seated for 35 minutes.
The airplane was good. It was loud, hot and fast. We were flying over the North Korean border and some of the houses of people passing in front of us were in rubble because of the 12 November earthquake. That night, I fell asleep and slept for 9 hours.
At 12:15am, the first meal was breakfast. Then there were chicken porridge. I ate it for a whole day and felt very full. We flew for 12 hours and landed in Saigon. The restaurant was quite nice and nice. I got a bowl of rice with hot chicken and a small cup of drink and ate everything at once.
While at the Vietnamese Airbnb, I made friends with three fellow Americans. 3 of us went to the buffet dinner with all the food provided. We all drank beer. We laughed a lot and the guys brought out a lighter to light the meal.
After the meal, I tried a motorbike for rent and it was an incredible experience. This made me so happy that I had to go to Saigon again. I had all the things I need when I go back to Vietnam.

At the world's most awkward family reunion, the entertainment is a mind-reading machine that knows who we are and what we want.
Stranger Things is basically just a glorified episode of The X Factor. Every contestant is a virtual personality trapped in a 1980s season of the music video show, including the winner, and the last contestant standing.
Jeff Goldblum apparently didn’t watch the whole thing because, in 2016, he actually created a machine that predicts who will win the next season of Stranger Things.
If you’re looking for a wildly entertaining, totally unnecessary game show, it’s likely on Netflix.
According to the Stranger Things creators, the machine uses a VERY long list of information about the characters on the show to predict who wins the next season. The machine also uses the same information to predict who wins the next episode of any other show.
You know, if your character gets locked in a room with all the children in 1983, there might be a huge chance he'll be hooded by a nearby child trying to escape from the window.
I honestly have no idea who won the last Stranger Things season, and I have no idea what’s next for the show.

The first snowfall of the year blanketed the town in white last night, and the incessant flake-size snow pelted our glasses and wiped the paint off of every kitchen surface. We were warm inside, but without the cold air to get up out of bed, most of us dressed in our pajamas and scarves to keep warm. We sat on top of every large object in the house (as we sleep in the living room these days) to keep warm. This was a record-breaking night, and we didn’t feel the need to check in on weather reports.

On a distant planet, scientists discover a signal emanating from the core of a nearly-uninhabited planet. Here they find the remains of the lone scantiest survivors of the vessel, a starship crew of two hundred men in an ancient reactor room. Before they can begin exploring, however, the scientific team finds a derelict construct on the planet's surface, housing some of their own.
Blink-182 is a pioneering rock band from Los Angeles, California. The band has sold over 15 million records worldwide, and its members have been involved in various aspects of popular music—as doomed artists, members of adolescent groups and actors. A number of their songs, along with their music videos, have been shortlisted for Grammy Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, and MTV Europe Music Awards. They have also been featured on a variety of popular television shows and have appeared in major motion pictures and video games.
Ghosted by accident, one night while working in Los Angeles, hip-hop producer/singer Cue-li (Alex Koenig) is inexplicably transferred to an alternate dimension of reality. When Cue-li and his fellow dreamers are asked to exchange locations with the other dreamers, they are also transferred to an alternate world, in which Alex Koenig now resides. As he attempts to piece together his new existence, he meets 18-year-old Shayla, the daughter of the beloved pizzeria owner, who shares a chilling connection to him and introduces him to a woman he can't ignore.
On a distant planet, scientists discover a signal emanating from the core of a nearly-uninhabited planet. Here they find the remains of the lone scantest of the lone scanties that remain of the vessel, a starship crew of two hundred men in an ancient reactor room. Before they can begin exploring, however, the scientific team finds a derelict construct on the planet's surface, housing some of its own.
Eventually, Cue-li meets Shayla (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a talented violinist who lives a solitary life with her father. They begin a romance. Then Cue-li, who has been through enough to deserve the chance to experience a more open universe, is unwilling to exchange his location, with Shayla becoming part of a larger plot to infiltrate his family's restaurant.
Interestingly, other near-future films that share this idea have failed to ignite, either in the box office or critically, such as The Dark Knight, Urban Legend, Minority Report, The Exorcist, and I Am Legend.

Wandering through the old city, one finds it impossible not to notice the Church of the Holy Spirits. Squatting in a cobbled alley off Via Dolorosa is a large stone building that no one seems to know much about. Inside, even if you've never heard of it, you will find two chapels and, in a corridor off one of the halls, the entrance to a small windowless room. The date of its construction is unknown, and its original function is unknown. The archaeological findings are almost certainly of Roman origin.
No one seems to know what it is. The mystery remains a whole thing of intrigue and mystery, since rumors have abounded for centuries, and no one seems to be able to explain them. The stone windowless room is a kind of testament to the ruins of the ancient city, and has been the subject of long speculations about its origin.

Beneath the surface of the calm lake lies the one area of the valley that is often turned into a nightmare for drivers – the narrow, twisting lane of dangerous Emergency Services. A narrow strip of road that no one wants to be driving on!
But with under 2 miles of road to walk to take you out of a tight spot and 2.1 miles of wide roads to get out, Emergency services have to be quick about their responses and that’s what the BHSSC is doing to help.
A new training course has been launched that will not only help them to be quicker and safer on emergency crews – it will also save a company money.
Established to help emergency services achieve this, the BHSSC are behind the specially designed course to teach them what to do when they are called out to a site.
The course focuses on three main areas of practice, the driver or driver-carer, the fire officer and the police.
It will cover the differences in how they see the area of the road where a crewed vehicle may be encountered, the effect of traffic on the driver’s personal space and car and the hazards that can arise in a tight spot.
“Talk to your colleagues about the training and hopefully they will be willing to help in some way,” says Louise McGuinness, head of education and development at the BHSSC.
“We have developed the course to ensure people are fully prepared, give sound advice and they are able to follow through.”
The training covers different weather conditions, evacuation, first aid and critical care.
The course is suitable for all crewed emergency services personnel including police, firefighters and ambulance service paramedics. It can also be taken by other emergency service crews who have been requested to attend.
The course is a three-day course and there are times to drop in or drop out as needed. It is not compulsory and everyone who attends is free to take it when they are able to.
“Taking on board your colleagues is a huge step for the BHSSC and with this course, we hope to give them confidence,” adds McGuinness.
The training is being rolled out over the next year to 500 members of the emergency services and after that to 1,000 further crews, ambulance crews, search and rescue and council units.
“The course is a great addition to what we already have and we feel it is a stepping stone to the future,” adds McGuinness.
“This will be the first of its kind in Scotland and it will hopefully give the information to help the public too.”
If you are interested in the course or have any questions about it, please get in touch with the BHSSC at info@bhsschildren.org.uk
The BHSSC is also in the process of setting up an online course to cover all the core skills and information people need in the emergency services to know. This will be available in spring 2019 and the cost will be negotiated with the provider, not be included in any training or assessment fees.

Amid the chaos of the storm, a pair of spectators from the Thames Valley Rugby Fan Group and Tim Murphy of Richmond RFC got together and grabbed themselves into their vehicles and set off for Wales.
While the rest of the nation headed to work on the Saturday night, the two Londoners stayed up to watch on TV, even if it meant soaking in a game that saw a ‘smash’ of a try scored to leave England fans with their heads stuck in the sand.
The 19-year-old student from Chiswick says he enjoyed the game.
“I didn’t watch much and enjoyed being able to jump on the end of my bed and have my own conversation.
“It was disappointing to see England beaten but we mustn’t let that dishearten us.

Whispered secrets of the forest are whispered and embraced, yet hidden deep below the forests the sea is just a breath away.

The decision to embark on a solo travel adventure leads to life-changing experiences in some surprising ways.
A mother of two from Hendersonville, TN, set off on a solo trip in July of 2008. It was her fourth solo trip.
“I was feeling good in the summer and over the summer it was a great time to take a vacation, but as you know, vacationing on your own can be stressful, and life can get in the way,” said Lynn.
But the vacation didn’t go the way she had planned. She had planned to spend three weeks relaxing in Cancun, Mexico, but ended up only being able to leave 24 hours later and return to the airport to spend the night.
On top of that, her daughter was starting preschool and she had been to the family doctor only once in her life.
“The doctor told me that as I would get older, I would get more frequent eye exams,” said Lynn.
She got the nod, but then realized she was staring at two years. She had to wait eight weeks, but they were woefully inadequate for a specialist’s exam and the eye doctor warned her it might take 18 months.
Hey, she was going to be 49 when she left. Just a bit too long.
Then, her sister was having a baby, and she had wanted to travel to Ireland, so she asked her to drive her to a nightclub. The mamacita was awesome, but she got back on the road to rebound with her vacation.
On the way home she realized she needed to get a rest. She found the RV at a stop light, and made an U-turn and went home, making sure to send a copy of her passport to the son she didn’t know.
Lynn had been to 10 different countries, so it didn’t take long for her husband to figure out that she was on her own again.
“I told him that when he got home he had to go and wake my up for a rest,” said Lynn.
Lynn has been asked many times by friends and family what she had gotten out of it.
She found it to be the best experience of her life, but even that was limited.
“I wasn’t as relaxed as I wanted to be because of the anticipation, and I was sitting around the whole time trying to get something to eat,” said Lynn.
At the end of the trip she had more than a whole year to live, but she realized it wasn’t too late to live the life she had always dreamed of.
“I thought I didn’t have much more time to live and I was so disappointed when I didn’t get to do all the things I wanted to do,” said Lynn.
Afterwards she was overcome with emotion and decided to put everything together and have a more traditional wedding. She had never been to a wedding, so she chose to pick out the flower for her own ceremony and had the reception at her own location.
“She really got to experience it the way she wanted it to be,” said Matt.
Lynn and her sister celebrated their birthdays with friends and family in November.
“I was able to get the dream of a lifetime, and it really does have made an impact on the way I look at things,” said Lynn.
Lynn believes her solo trip gave her some peace and solitude to think and to examine her life. Her next adventure will have to wait until she’s in her 50s, but that’s no matter.
“I think at 49 I would have done the same trip at 49,” said Lynn.

If you liked the prequel novel that brought you to Strange Amusement Park, this one will further your appetite for more Halloween adventures.

When a scientist's experiment to clone famous historical figures goes hilariously wrong, the lab is suddenly filled with strange aliens and a bizarrely sinister experiment is about to go horribly wrong.
In an exotic island colony that's become a center for the most strange experiments, a group of scientists led by Professor Anne Wilkins comes up with a method to take a seemingly humanoid lab rat and create what they refer to as a human-looking mutant mouse.
The result, of course, is a horrible mistake. The lab rat is the exact same as the one that is being cloned, with the obvious difference being that the one being cloned is wearing some artificial pair of blood earrings, so every time the scientists try to mimic the rat in an experiment, it looks more like the half-orc-half-wolf kidnapped by the Nazis in the first Terminator movie. And while these aliens are only concerned with their survival, the fact that they're half-animal monsters doesn't stop them killing and eating the unfortunate lab rats in a big skull... And then there's the other part.
At the end, the scientists face the horrible and monstrous consequences of their mistakes in an all-out war that will determine the future of humanity. Written by writer Christopher Moore and director Tim Bevan, with the screenplay by the duo.

In a town where everyone's dreams are broadcasted on TV, one person's dream about finding his name written on the sandy beach of Ana's cove could be just a wish.
But one chance, and little Annaya could become a reality. Her name is marked on the sand, but her thoughts are far from following the white snow.
The simple, perfect life is ruined when Annaya finds a wading bird naked in the ocean. To solve the riddle, she'll have to join forces with the bearded, silent man who's known as the Beachman. But the truth is more sinister.
The novel is set in a town where the tattoos mean something very sinister. There is, however, a paradise, as well as a place that just isn't what it seems. I'll be honest, this is the second book in the series, and I'm very glad I read the first one as I really enjoyed it. It's unusual to have such a great story that will make you cry or smile, and that's because it's not some creepy doll playing her name in someone's ears. This is a story about finding hope, overcoming fear and finally living the dream you've been trying to fulfill.

During the world's quietest concert, the audience realizes the music is not heard, but felt through the very sense of touch. With her first CD Elegant Imperfection, violinist Christine Perri found that this phenomenon (no pun intended) is universal and common to everyone.
The CD was recorded during the last months of 2005 and is a part of her latest endeavor: her second solo CD Thousands of Tiny Secrets, out in July 2007. The concept of the CD came from a recent conversation with a friend, who said, "I am a very small person and I play violin very small."
This was the basis of her answer when asked the age of her instruments: an 1810 Stradivarius violin. For the rest of the CD, the entire violin is played with just the right touch, rather than the full sound of the instrument.
The CD opens with "Suite No. 2" from the children's music collection "The Story of a Dog and a Rabbit" by Leo Dalour. The suitably acoustic sound is projected over a major work called "Suite No. 1" for violin and piano, by Dmitri Shostakovich. The suitably acoustic sound is projected over a major work called "Symphony No. 6" for violin and orchestra, by Shostakovich. The CD ends with two duets, by Zanele Muholi and Mireille Brugada, an altruistic combination of violinist and keyboardist.
Some say they are simply self-assured, others say that they are all self-assured. But this review does not deny their ability to be assured, although it certainly is obvious through this one. A 19th century violin of truly superb craftsmanship. The sound of the violin is truly amazing.
What the viola did not say was, at least in the CD's opening, how in a piece of music such as "Symphony No. 5" by the Albanian pianist she plays on the CD, the listener could not necessarily connect the two personalities of the violin and the piano player of the CD. Maybe the violin and piano player are so similar in their everyday, humdrum lives, that they do not interact in concert, that they are the same thing? Whatever the reason, in a piece such as the violin's muted double-stop, the violin was quite upstaged.
The Mireille Brugada and Zanele Muholi on this CD are such a team. Their collaboration is, in some ways, the complete opposite of what is actually happening in the recording: the sound of each of them is much more clearly heard. They were playing together, I thought, as if they were playing as a team. I guess you can say they were playing to themselves.
It's not always about teamwork. It's about being a player, who only wants to make sound. Well, it was actually that way when the two players were onstage, a couple of years ago. The CD was just released, and the premiere for the album and concerts was to take place a month or two later. And what happened? They just played the CD.
I don't think I've ever heard anything so closely synchronized by two players of the violin. I'd like to hear more of that, with the kind of music that makes violinists go to that place within themselves they rarely get to access. But at the risk of having to replay this piece of music a couple of times in my head before it could be enjoyed, I think you can thank the violinist for this. She won't be afraid of being the star, in a situation such as this one.
Some of these people, I mean. I had no idea. What I really wanted was to be the star. At least, this CD seemed to suggest it.

The gentle hum of the city at dawn brought a hush of quiet to my life. It stirred a part of me that I'd never seen before, brought into a brooding oneness with nature. The joy of the world, the wonder of its infinite harmony, filled the air and radiated from the centre of our being.
Like a silver flower in the grass the sky deepened with the majesty of day. Life seemed to be born over the sky and the world. All was still, the wind was quiet, the birds sang and the moon shone on the white sky, and the mists were thick with the leaves of the woods and through the trunk of the oaks burst forth the pale droplets of the dew. And for the first time I had seen a street. An old man, my host, gave me the key to the house and I entered into the house.
An unreliable memory? This might be the essence of his tale.
He and his friend had died when he was 14 or 15. At 16, due to severe rickets (of which his father was the one to be blamed), he moved to the home of a relative, aged 24. He didn't find work and was stuck there for 16 years, until he contracted the same ailment as his friend, which is what killed him.
It may have been the life experience, the death experience, or both, that wrote this tale. After many (or all) years of living on the periphery of human civilisation, I seem to find the world a more dazzling, colourful place now.
Perhaps, I can call myself a New Age Tea Pot Utopian. Or whatever term works for this weird type of human being.
Life comes and goes. And then there is this.

In a world where snails are the fastest creatures, the annual Snail Racing Championship is scandalized by a snail on the ground in question.
But before the contest's rounds get started, there is a surprise: a flash-bulb meeting will open the race's field for a chance to win a prize of $15,000.
Unfortunately, the champion snail is killed in an accident on the track. But surviving animals quickly try to convince a track official they are the real winner by banging on the track's door.
In the end, a snail from a different world wins the prize. But it only lasts for a few seconds, as the prize has no flattening - nothing to make a draggy snail like flies and/or slugs.

A mysterious artifact uncovered in Egypt revealed the start of an ancient civilization
A team from the American University in Cairo unearthed a mysterious tomb filled with astonishing findings. The artifacts and discoveries will help scientists understand the Egyptians and their ancestors.
Although the tomb has been investigated since the beginning of the year, the details on the state of the tomb, its deteriorated condition, and the whole tomb’s contents are still unclear.
A team of researchers, led by a group of scientists from the American University in Cairo, examined the tomb, located in Giza Plateau, outside the Egyptian capital. While the tomb is huge, its origins are still unknown. It is believed that the tomb was constructed sometime during the 15th century B.C.E.
The team discovered an ancient Egyptian tomb called a sepulchral complex. This tomb is large, but is believed to be built on a structure called the Amenhotep II resting place, which was once a royal family shrine to the mummies of the former pharaoh.
Experts believe that Amenhotep II was buried on a small mound, while his female priestess was buried on the other side of the tomb.
The Archaeology of Giza and other ancient Egyptian tombs
The ancient Egyptians believed in a mummy cult. These tombs were usually made of stone, mud, and a jasmine vine that was used to encase the mummies inside the burial chamber.
There were also tombs constructed for royalty, which were located in the vicinity of the Amenhotep II mummies’ tomb.
Due to their age and complexity, the tombs were considered important locations, where mummies could be protected from the elements.
According to a report by A. Nassib, the tomb has long been a focus of archaeologists and experts.
The team discovered an old doorway, covered by a layer of vines. The secret passage is located in a small, enclosed courtyard. They also found another entrance, which leads to the southeastern side of the tomb.
It is believed that the original entrance of the tomb was opened to the outside world by a giant fire. After that, the tomb was sealed, causing it to rot.
Ancient Egyptians built many temples. During the Ptolemaic period, a great religious movement developed in Egypt. While the city of Thebes was the center of the ancient civilization, other cities like Alexandria and Karnak also became known for their religious beliefs.
The German archaeologist Ludwig v. Bunning built a temple to Ptolemy, which is believed to be one of the oldest in the world. In 1864, Egyptologist Giovanni Battista Cassaddei found 50 tombs on the outskirts of the city.
It was believed that these tombs had undergone decades of desecration. The purpose of these tombs was believed to be the tomb of the deceased pharaoh or the temple they were buried in.
The location of these tombs was unimportant, and it is believed that the tombs were not dug for religious purposes.
It is also believed that a select few tombs were always in use. The knowledge of tombs is not something that many people understand.
Ancient tombs are filled with gold, turquoise, and metallic bronze, gems, and even papyrus scrolls. These tombs have an estimated value of over 1 million Egyptian pounds ($13 million).
The Egyptians believed in living after death. Their famous mummies are now considered priceless, having been mummified more than 3,500 years ago. The mummies, which are still alive, had been buried on a nearby island, as a result of the Egyptian catastrophe.
What to do with the Egyptian Mummies?
Since it is believed that Egyptians believed in the idea of “ascending to eternal life.” While they buried their dead in the ground and decompose into water and fire, they often turned the corpse into mummies, which were then buried in a tomb.
In 1864, more than 50 tombs were found, of which only 20 were excavated.
The researchers who carried out the excavation were led by George John Briennig.
The tombs were found in far-off places. Many tombs are believed to have been built on sacred mountains. These tombs were very popular, especially during the Ptolemaic period. It is believed that in the late 5th century B.C.E., the so-called Golden Age of Egypt, the country lost its hold on the entire Middle East.
Egypt’s political and cultural relevance decreased, which is attributed to the growing interests of the new Arab nations and the declining influence of the mighty Roman Empire.
Although some of the tombs were discovered to have been lost, the majority of them were hidden and left untouched.
Through the excavation process, many mysteries were revealed. The experts have been able to discern the types of tools used by the people who built these tombs.
Ancient Egyptian Mummies
The Egyptians were skilled in engineering and architecture. It is believed that most tombs were built using the same techniques.
It was believed that the Egyptians were buried in large tombs, with a servant helping the deceased to the back. The entire process was completed using special mortars that were required for the tomb.
After the death of the deceased, the tombs were covered by a thick wall. After the wall was constructed, the tombs were covered with a layer of colored mud.
It is believed that the quality of the tomb was decided by the number of coffins and mummies inside the tomb.
More than 3,000 mummies were discovered in the tomb, and they had been relocated to other tombs.
Many researchers were attracted to the tombs. They were able to discover ancient cults that people used. It was believed that these cults were related to the belief of eternal life after death.
The purpose of the discovery was to be able to create a tomb of the dead that would not decay, making it eternal.
There is a lot to discover, and scientists will have to go back and read the ancient texts to understand the meaning of the artifacts.
Egypt’s Present
Egypt is located in North Africa, Northwest Asia, and the Red Sea area. The official languages are Arabic, French, English, and Russian.
Egypt has developed into a tourist destination with many tourists coming from different places. Most of the people come from around the world and are divided into different categories based on their needs.
According to the report published by Egypt Today, the number of people who visit Egypt in 2019 was around 3.5 million. The number of people who visit Egypt annually is around 10 million.

Under the starlit sky, the campers gathered in front of the tent to begin the day’s activities. They recited the morning prayer and sang a song that kept their spirits uplifted. As the campers set up the tents, they practiced musical instruments and the pipe organ. Their favorite activity was working on puzzles to learn different words and make a puzzle-piece pattern.
Before lunch, the players took a break to snack on snacks and drink from the water cooler. They enjoyed singing songs and sharing stories. They also played a game to practice penmanship.
After lunch, the players listened to some quality time in stories. They discussed about not being afraid of reading books, chores, and other children in the camp. The players shared how it was easier to learn when they are surrounded by people that love them.
After lunch, the players played a music activity together. They sang and danced to a hearty tune. They also enjoyed telling stories, telling tall tales, and reciting nursery rhyme. The campers enjoyed doing icebreakers, trails and creating their own stories.
The day concluded with some quality time, and the campers went to sleep peacefully.

The artist's brush danced across the canvas, creating an amazing variety of shapes, forms and textures. One piece had vibrant orange hues, another in dull tones with fiery red accents. Many of the works were done in the 1880's and early 1900's. One piece that was commissioned in 1916 by a wealthy collector and was moved to the Museum of Texas Tech in Lubbock.

At dawn, the mountains cast shadows that seemed to dominate the sky, creating a magnificent scene that looked faraway. In a calm and quiet atmosphere, looking back to look over my shoulder, I saw the iconic peak of Mount Fuji, one of Japan’s most representative mountains, gleaming in the moonlight, a 3,792-meter high tip that should not be missed in any itinerary around Japan.
Fueled by an early morning breakfast and the energy of the mountain, I left the hotel at 6:30 a.m. After a 20-minute drive, we entered Mount Fuji’s Monasana Hakuenai-jin station, which looked like a quiet and well-kept town with an abundance of shops and restaurants, while we all took off our shoes and entered the station’s entrance.
Upon checking in, we headed straight to the signboard, waiting for the train to depart. On the narrow train tracks, I felt that life was in good hands as we waited for the blossoming cherry trees along the route.
We arrived at the beginning of the route, to be greeted by a unique mosaic made of cherry blossoms that shone with red and pink blooms, and then immersed in nature. The serene environment, along with the sound of the blossoming trees, gave us the sense of being in the forest.
It seemed that we had almost been running from the airport to the Monasana Hakuenai-jin station, a little on the edge of town and with no people, but it felt like we had travelled to another world, as we entered a calming landscape.
We finally left the city and, just after 8:00 a.m., arrived at the Fuji 5 station, where we changed into our own clothes and put on our hats. As we prepared for the ascent, we all felt the mountain looming behind us, creating a calming sensation.
There was a light jacket around our waists and a hat in our hands, and while being a little gusty, we walked along the mountain tracks through lush green pine trees, waking up the natural environment, and heading straight up to the top of Mount Fuji.
Looking at the sea of clouds that were hiding at an altitude of 19,000 meters, it felt as if the clouds were just floating in the middle of a blue sea. The viewing platform on top was occupied by a group of people who had made a beautiful ceremony.
When the sun rose, it was indeed a scene of breathtaking beauty as we stood on the Fuji 5 Station’s viewing platform. We felt that the moment had arrived when we had reached the top of Mount Fuji, and that was also when we finally felt the experience of being in Japan, so we walked to the top of the mountain to enjoy the panoramic views.
Although we thought it was not high season, it was still an amazing day in Hakone, especially as we were able to enjoy the fresh air that fell through the trees along the mountainside.
After finishing up, we had a bit of a leisurely walk back to the hotel, which felt a bit like a pleasant summer afternoon in Hakone’s countryside.
At the base of Mount Fuji, there was a restaurant and a souvenir shop at the top of the hill, called “Onigiri”—the latter literally means fresh rice and a type of food from a traditional Japanese dish that includes meat, raw vegetables, and rice.
You can experience the traditional cuisine at the mountain restaurant, “Onigiri,” which was almost an outdoor café that embodied a sense of freedom and a joyful atmosphere, where you can be surrounded by nature without having to be too far from the city center.
The main courses of the meal included fresh pork, various kinds of nigiri (rice balls), egg dishes, and “Itako,” which are seafood dishes with dashi, which consists of a budo (herb-soaked rice, safflower), pickles, and seabass, and is also a common meal in Japan.
In addition to the meals at “Onigiri,” there were also several restaurants at the base of Mount Fuji that were offering meals and drinks, and a café with a view that was the perfect location to enjoy the stunning sunset.
After finishing up, we ended up not eating very much at “Onigiri,” but instead got into a 12-kilometer-long hiking trail, called “Fuji Trail,” by taking a taxi back to the city center.
The trail also gave a beautiful view of the city, with blossoming cherry trees at the top, which provided a delightful contrast between green and red, and after finishing it, we walked around the city’s city gates, which once again gave us that calm and peaceful sensation, as if we had entered a temple where we had been taken to a heavenly paradise.
It was at this moment that we saw the body of two Russian-Japanese men who had collapsed in front of Mount Fuji. Although the situation was unfortunate, it seemed that they had already received the best of fortune as the sun was setting, with lush greenery and a perfect light.
I began thinking about the many people who have died while climbing in the mountains, as if they were preparing for a great feast of happiness, and it was as if it was about to happen.

Underneath the moonlit sky, the path leads to the remains of an ancient temple, now hidden behind forest. With a gleaming golden altar and a giant statue of god, it can still be seen from afar. Even the ancient inhabitants of the temple were unable to deal with the intense energy and grandeur of the ancient temple, and no one managed to fully appreciate the grandeur before the tombs were built around it. As the trance of the spiritism spread throughout the temple, the religious activities gradually dwindled. The devotees slowly vanished from the temple, leaving the altar and the altar itself as a mysterious temple in ruin, a mark of the ancient glory that must never be forgotten.
When Yu Shi returned to Xingshan, she immediately asked Qian Xu to investigate the current state of the temple, and found that the altar was empty. She then went up to see the temple, but she could not see anyone there. Even though the temple was supposed to be there, it was still completely empty. Fortunately, she heard some voices from inside.
