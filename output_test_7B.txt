The serene landscape of the countryside was not just my place of solace but also a resting ground for people to find themselves, for me to find myself and to reflect, like meditation. It was the fertile ground that nurtured my spirit. To take the silence seriously and let the silence speak to me. This is how I seek to unlock the inner creativity and human potential that is unique to me and to mankind.
To encounter a true life, we must engage in a dialogue with nature, with the cosmos, with the inner world. When we work with the essence of the object, we also open a path towards the absolute value of the world and can find our true soul. This artistic approach to the interdependence of life and artistic material is present in my work from the beginning of my creative work.
I am a researcher, a creative explorer and a designer who constantly asks questions about creativity, society and humanity.
I try to link creativity and research to help humankind as a designer, artist and visionary, the new version of Gesamtkunstwerk, to solve global issues. I am interested in the intersection of interdisciplinary topics, in research and in nature. And with these three elements, I try to create harmony in my work: the interface between biology, materials and humanity.
My work can be understood as the inner monologue of nature, as a bridge between the inner and the outer world, to expand people's senses and to promote their deep understanding of nature, humans, and society.
Research and art are integrated in my creative process. Through research, I transform nature into my materials. I take the minerals as my canvas and investigate human DNA through biology, light, and sound. Through experimentation and deep exploration, I work to create harmony between the inner and outer worlds. The focus is on environmental issues and human life as a whole.
My artistic work has also become a platform for people to have deeper reflection and to awaken their inner self to find meaning in nature. The human body becomes a kind of laboratory that reflects both the inner and outer world. It is an observatory that reveals the essence of nature and the mysteries of life. Through research, we can understand ourselves and the world better, and re-connect with nature.
“THE ALCHEMIST” ASKED THE GARDEN TO HOLD THE CONVERSATION
The Alchemist tries to explore the connection between self and nature. Our psychological and physical state is the natural response to our environment, and this inner world is the dialogue of the nature. We are constantly trying to describe the essence of things, to define it, to grasp it, and to reveal the true nature of it.
Through exploration and deep reflection, we seek the answers to questions about life and our inner world. To investigate the truth, the nature, and the deep meaning of life, we can enhance our self and re-connect with the true self. Through self-discovery and nature observation, we can observe and reflect on the internal and external world. In order to understand ourselves better, we need to re-connect with the nature.
Between the human and the natural world, there is a relationship between inside and outside. This is a unique vision and state, and the start of human wisdom. It is about the mystery of the universe and the deeper meaning of life. Through this feeling of the essence, we create the intersection between the inner world and the outer world and find our true self.
Art can help us to understand and solve many problems by investigating the nature and the human beings from the inner and outer world. Through dialogue with nature, we seek the truth of human nature and society, and reflect our inner world and the environment.
Through research, I transform nature into my materials. The minerals are my materials, and my materials are the inner self of nature. I take the minerals as my canvas to express the human body as a "biological microscope." Through the examination of the human body and the landscape of the earth's crust, I have found the biological and spatial representation in nature and art, and I express them with sculpture.
The process of research and artistic creation is an exploration of the deep dialogue between the outer and inner worlds. It is the relationship of the human body and the landscape of the earth's crust.
CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATION: MINERAL CANVAS
Through my series of experimental work, the image of "bio-graphy" is developed, which reveals the deep link between human DNA and the landscape of the earth's crust. Through the digestion and transformation of various minerals, I create a unique approach to organic art.
The transformation of raw materials, the transformation of physical and chemical elements, the expression of the essence and the true value of things, can help us to break the boundaries between life and nature, and through the dialogue and cooperation between man and nature, we can find the essence and life of ourselves.
The transformation of the environment into materials is a method of self-reflection, and research can play an important role in this process. Through exploration and deep reflection, the relationship between self and nature can be enhanced.
When we use materials that reflect the inner world, we are not only creating art but also becoming a creator of nature.
TRANSFORMING BIOLOGY INTO ART
The "STONE BODY SERIES" is an experimental project that transforms raw materials into biological art. Minerals become my canvas, my body is a canvas, I conduct experiments with bio-pigments, and through the transformation of minerals, we can observe human DNA through biology, light, and sound.
Through the dialogue with nature, we can observe human DNA in deeper ways and transform ourselves into a new form of art. This series of works uses mineral elements such as granite, graphite, quartz, and diamond to explore human DNA and DNA in the natural world.
In this series of experimental works, we connect the inner and outer worlds through the exploration of minerals as materials, human bio-chemicals, and the Earth's geological structure. This project aims to discover the mysterious and precious essence of nature and create a unique link between art and science.
TRANSCENDING TO THE EARTH’S MIND: NATURE AND HUMANITY
The human body is the inner world and outer world. The human body as an observatory is a bridge between the inner world and outer world. Through the exploration of various materials, our spiritual and physical state, the natural world, and the essence of life, it can reflect the mysterious beauty of nature.
Art is to connect and re-connect the world to nature. And through deep reflection, we find the inner and outer world of the body. We may encounter many mysteries and the truth hidden in the landscape, the human body, and the internal world.
Through art, we may have a better understanding of the mysterious beauty of nature and the complexity of the human body and the world. This is a unique way of experiencing the nature and the human body.
Through observation, contemplation, and study, I create a unique and vibrant link between human beings and nature. This is a vision of how to see ourselves and the world, through the silent and deep look.

In the depths of the ancient forest, there is a garden full of mysteries. The paths open up in front of us, inviting us to discover the delicate atmosphere of each different section.
At the heart of the garden is a large pond with waterlilies, there is also a small waterfall that runs from the summit of the water tower.
At its foot are ferns and palm trees, crossed by a path that ascends to the top of the garden.
In the centre of the pond is a stone bridge with a wooden handrail, next to it are two small benches, perfect for taking a breather. In one of the small wood-lined rooms is an ancient magnolia tree, in the middle of the garden is a greenhouse full of exotic plants.
Gardens created with care and attention to detail, where the fountains and water mirrors act as a backdrop for the vegetation that creates a succession of landscapes, each with its own style.
Here, between well-kept lawns and flowerbeds, emerge camellias, rhododendrons, hydrangeas and azaleas, as well as delicate white rosebushes.
Through the doors of the small gatehouse, we access the Orchidery, the collection of exotic orchids and cymbidiums, planted in terracotta pots and flower beds.
From the terrace we overlook the lower pond.

All the while, Chelsea's trying to make the Emporium a success, not to mention the fact that she's now in charge of raising two overexcitable hellhounds and her surly ghost who's anything but helpful.
Life couldn't get more complicated. Or so she thinks...
A welcome return to Krystal Shannan's Haunted Charm series, The Midnight Howl is a supernatural mystery that will enthral and entertain.
Praise for The Midnight Howl:
"Words cannot describe the joy of picking up the book from Shannan and allowing her to whisk me away to her very own paranormal and magical world filled with mystery, murder and romance. I would highly recommend reading the series in order so you can get a better feel for the stories and characters. Don't say I didn't warn you, because you will not want to put this series down once you start reading."
"I enjoyed how the author blends comedy into a mystery/paranormal novel. With a little bit of slapstick thrown in and I was laughing, then she has a serious moment where I was a bit choked up, and then the next thing you know the story goes into action...So even though there are paranormal elements, there are serious ones too, and I found it a very entertaining read."
"I can't recommend this book enough and I will definitely be purchasing the rest of the series."
"Wow, what a fun read. ...These characters and situations are so real I felt I was experiencing the story right along with the characters. Love at first sight! Love at first sight!"
"This was one of the best Paranormal Romance I have read. I absolutely loved this story."
Krystal Shannan is a Paranormal Romance author who loves reading all sorts of genres. Writing was always a hobby of hers. Finally, with the encouragement of her husband and two young children, she decided to complete her first novel in late 2011.

I'm fairly new to this author, and have yet to read a book by her that I didn't like. She definitely has a knack for telling fun, magical stories! This one was really fantastic and I didn't want to put it down.
The cover is very pretty and looks like it'd fit in perfectly in the fantasy section of the book store! I really like the dress on the cover as well, it's very simple but eye catching!
The plot was pretty good, though I'm sure I missed a few details due to the fact that I haven't read the first book, In Her Service. However, I was still able to follow along with this story! I loved all the fantasy elements and magic within this story! I also really enjoyed the characters and getting to know them! The story is told in 3rd person and alternates perspectives between a few characters.
I really liked the love interest and main character, Olivia. She's a strong and independent woman and I really enjoyed reading her perspective! I loved the ending to this book, and I'm excited to continue the series!

A “ferocious feminist romp through the Wild West” (Kirkus) from the author of A Boy Called Bat—for fans of Laura Ruby and Natalie Lloyd.
Saddle up for this adventurous romp, full of Old West action and plenty of Black Stetson sister power!
Crow is a Black Stetson. A Stetson is a bandit. But Crow is nothing like a bandit. She's just a regular girl who dreams of becoming a lady--and if she wants to be a lady, she's got to stop talking like a bandit. Or that's what her mom always said.
But Crow can't stop talking like a bandit. She was born to it. All Crow has ever wanted to do is be a bandit. Except now, Crow is worried she might not be a bandit after all. Because it's hard to steal from a woman with no mouth.
Will Crow still be a bandit, or is she just a Black Stetson after all?
This story is a bit of a slow starter and takes a while to get into, but eventually it gets pretty good!
I liked the main character, Crow, a lot and found her to be a very strong woman. Her determination and drive was admirable, and I loved that she was so strong!
The ending of this story had me laughing out loud! I loved how it ended, and I can't wait to read more books by this author.
Overall, this book was an okay read for me. I was a bit confused at times about the story, but it was definitely interesting and enjoyable. This book was written very well and I'd recommend this story to anyone interested in reading historical fiction!

Natural and human-made disasters have left most of the world uninhabitable. Welcome to the U.S. Refugee Camp, a permanent shelter filled with those who've been displaced.
In the Camp, Eli, a former Marine, has found an opportunity to become a transporter. He's the only one who has the motor skills to ride through the radioactive dust clouds that have engulfed the landscape. There, Eli makes a difficult decision to take a dangerous mission that will determine his future.
Recommended for those who enjoy science fiction, survival, and deep space epics.
This book was definitely pretty good, but I don't think it was the best in the series! This book is definitely more plot driven rather than character driven and it was difficult to get a feel for any of the characters at times.
The beginning of the book was a bit slow, and took a long time to get into the story and for things to start happening. However, I thought that the characters and ending to the story were really good!
I loved Eli, the main character, and really enjoyed getting to know him and his personality. I thought he was a great character and loved reading his perspective!
Overall, this book was a bit of a slow starter but eventually got pretty good! I'd recommend this series to anyone who likes science fiction and action!

Everyone's favorite little town of Creekwood has a secret or two...like the time Hannah Marks accidentally fell in love with the new boy and almost kissed him...in front of everyone. Or her neighbor Salimy's squirrel that can talk. But the biggest secret of all...that one person who can't stop wishing Hannah's fall-for-him fairy tales were real life. It's been a year since Hannah got her wish. A year since she fell in love. A year since Salimy's squirrel disappeared. A year since she wrote "The Wish Song" with her best friend, and watched him leave to start his first tour in Afghanistan. But sometimes wishes do come true, and for Hannah, the wish song takes on a whole new meaning. Hannah isn't going to let losing Matt change her story. And now, she's finally ready to write her own ending.
This story is a sequel to If Only I Could Tell You, and the second book in the series. It's a companion novel though, so if you haven't read the first book, you can still read this one. There is some information about the events of the first book but nothing really important, so you won't get lost. The first book is told from Ben's perspective, and this one is told from Hannah's perspective.
I did not like the writing style of this book. It seemed very repetitive and was very similar to the writing style of the first book. I also didn't like the rushed ending. I found it to be extremely abrupt and not as well written as the rest of the book.
I did like Hannah's character though, and thought that she was a very sweet character. I liked reading about her life and getting to know her!
Overall, I didn't really enjoy this story and found the writing style to be extremely slow and repetitive. I don't think that I'll be continuing this series.

Because if he's going to find a home, he may have to invent one.
This story was definitely a bit different from what I was expecting! I thought that it was definitely a fun read, and I loved the characters and their personalities!
The cover of this book is super cute and the book itself has a cute interior as well! I think that this book is a great book to pick up if you're in the mood for a cute, easy read!
The main character was really sweet and cute, and I loved getting to know him and his personality! The ending to this story was pretty sad but I still enjoyed it.

Amidst the ruins of the old castle, a modern story begins…
A war between two brothers fought over the same woman leads to a deep, dark secret that can be hidden in an idyllic setting, but can’t be buried forever.
In 1400, Liege and Beaurevoir fought over their shared woman, Renée of Nassau. Members of their respective families came to the Duchy to settle the matter… and died in the process. As a result, the feud was kept secret, but not forgotten.
In 1894, the construction of a castle began in the region, prompted by the massive oak tree, labeled the “Gage de Dieu”, or “Sign of God.” The project was left unfinished upon the arrival of the First World War. When the tree fell in 1918, the site was abandoned for almost one hundred years.
Now, the construction is finished, but the ghosts of the past have returned, determined to reveal the dark, secret history behind the château…
The games narrated here are rich in special features, to be enjoyed by the most die-hard of gamers.

The detective pondered over the clues, which seemed to him of no importance, but which had provoked his chief’s interest. Then he went out and spent some time on a sudden inspection of the premises of the hotel, and returned to the room of Sapper, to follow up his findings.
His companion had followed him at a respectful distance, but De Castro seized the opportunity to suggest to his companion that his services were no longer necessary.
The detective was vexed, but he did not reply. He merely nodded and went on.
A few moments later, Sapper’s friend returned to the dining room with a mixed salad and some asparagus tips in a white porcelain dish, to which he added a small glass of bouillon and a bottle of Bordeaux. He then sat down at a table near the window, and began to eat the soup and the vegetables with great appetite. He did not seem to have noticed that his clerk had disappeared.
Happily, to the extent of his knowledge of seaman’s physiology, he found the effects of the last emetic almost instantaneous, and the sufferer lay back, revived and feeling better. He began by cleaning the room, which was in a great state of confusion, arranging the clothes that had been left on the floor, and the objects which had been thrown to the four winds in his struggle with the captain.
He looked all over the room in a masterly way, and then, on a whim, opened a desk, and among the scattered papers found a roll of notes.
The detective left the room and sought his chief, who had just finished his work in the bureau of the first room and had returned to his office.
“I think,” the inspector replied, “that there is nothing to be done. We must wait till the doctor can get up, then we can take his measurements and his height, and if he is found he will tell us where he is.” The magistrate was extremely embarrassed, since he saw that to the friends of the officer there remained nothing but their fantastic hope in the possibility of finding him alive.
As Sapper had no direct interest in the investigation, the magistrate did not wish to act with great rapidity, but he thought it advisable to suggest to the captain’s friends the utility of communicating the disappearance to the police in their own towns, for his information showed that the captain had been in great favor there.
“Yes, all that, but now if you will excuse me, I have something to do, and it will be necessary to tell my colleagues the truth, for the truth is precious to me, for I have nothing but the truth.” Then he took his hat and went out.
And Sapper returned to his dinner. He ate and drank at his ease, and his satisfied gluttony had never bettered the course.
“Well, Monsieur Sapper, and how are we going to begin, then? And how can I do you this favor?” “I don’t ask you for anything at all, Monsieur, for I am sure that, whatever may be the character of my crime, I shall have time to make a confession and to give you a complete explanation. But I have no desire to expose myself to the possibility of an attempt against my life before I have talked. But to begin, I’ll say that I am going to my room.” “But if you get in the way of anyone, be careful; it is a ruinous job. He is no longer the man you see.
The detective found a linen travelling-bag in the room, where he packed the officer’s clothing. “It is a nice parcel,” he thought. “He can carry it through the streets and no one will suspect him. I will do this, for we must begin by rescuing him from the worthy Monsieur Sapper, and I don’t want to have to make excuses to my chief, because, after all, it is in my line to be delicate.” So the inspector went out, the key of the room in his hand, as well as that of the closet, the gate and the attic door.
A tall woman was standing in the doorway of the room. She was about thirty years old, and of striking beauty. She held a small boy in her arms, and had given him to a young woman who was waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs.
The inspector went and talked to her. The magistrate had told him that the captain’s wife had arrived the evening before. The magistrate did not know that this woman was in fact a young peasant girl of good family, who had come to Paris to improve her education, having been persuaded that a good position might be obtained for her. For two months she had been living in the same rooms with her cousin, and working as a laundress in order to earn some money. She had arrived at an unfortunate hour, and as the inn had no vacancies, she was put in the captain’s room. She had not been able to conceal from her cousin the fact that she had left the country in the company of the captain. But she kept to the road as long as she could, and having come to Paris, the ruin of the man whom she loved had cut her to the heart.
When she saw the officer’s baggage, she exclaimed in alarm, “What is that?” “Why, only what is necessary for a journey,” the inspector replied; “but it is much too heavy for him to carry.” “Ah,” she replied, “I know.” And she held out her hand for the baggage.

How To Tell If Your Marriage is Over

The novelist typed the final words of the book that I published in 1996 with a sentence that used an expression I hadn’t heard before: The bedside lights brightened.
When I looked up the word brightened, I found it meant a similar thing to two other words: brightened up and brightened over.
We use the expressions brightened up to mean become bright.
You’re really brightening up the room. (We use this expression to mean we’re happy to see someone.)
The sun is brightening up the room. (The sunshine is brightening up the room.)
I used brighten the room by setting a lamp on a stand in the corner and turning it on.
I brightened over the room by setting a lamp on the floor next to the bed.
We use the expression brightened over to mean become brighter.
The sun has brightened over. (The sunshine has brightened over the room.)
I brightened over the room by setting a lamp on the bedside table next to the bed.
My door and bedside are brightening up.
My door and bedside are brightening over.
I brightened my door and bedside by setting lamps on them.
Notice that we don’t use brighten over.
The people who first wrote about brighten used the expression brighten over.
My door and bedside are brightening over. (The sunshine is brightening over them.)
The grammar was much clearer in 1903 than in 1900 and 1898.
The sentence could be rewritten to make it more clear.
I brightened the room by setting a lamp on a stand in the corner and turning it on.
The sun brightened the room.
I brightened the room by setting a lamp on the floor next to the bed.
I brightened the room by setting a lamp on the bedside table next to the bed.
I brightened my door and bedside by setting lamps on them.
The sun has brightened.
One of the people who was first to write about the novelist’s sentence was H.W. Fowler in A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926). He wrote that it’s good practice to say brighten up and not brighten over.
I agree with him and try to avoid the expression brighten over.
“The sun brightens my room” is the best sentence.

Hidden within the ancient texts lies a prophetic picture of the global community that will happen in the future. God’s design for the nations is an assembly of nations all “God-breathed” through the power of the Holy Spirit. In other words, God will touch the hearts of people from every tribe, language, and nation (Revelation 5:9). I have come to realize that, by God’s grace, the East and the West are beginning to assemble together. The world is changing. God is moving in our generation to bring about a great and glorious reunion.
I am grateful to be part of that “process” – together with my colleagues around the world – doing our part in bringing about the reunion. I am grateful for the partnership I have had with the Asian leadership of Asia and the West. I am grateful for the partnership I have had with pastors around the world. I am grateful for the fact that we have come together to pray, to read the Bible, and to proclaim the Scriptures. These are precious times. The ultimate answer to unity is revealed in the New Testament, where the disciples came together in harmony and fellowship, in spite of their differences (Acts 2). There are so many reasons why we should be rejoicing and celebrating at this hour. There are so many reasons why we should be praising the Lord for the kind of ministry we have today.
I believe that the Lord has so much more for the churches that have come together. I believe that the Lord has so much more for you and for me. And that is why I rejoice and I celebrate. It is a privilege to be a part of the Lord’s mission to heal the world, heal the nations, and to bring about the reunion of His body, the church. It is a privilege to be a part of the “process” and the change that God is bringing about. God is doing something new in our generation. I praise the Lord for that. I give God all the glory for that. I also give you the charge to get involved in what God is doing. Take action. Be engaged. Be on fire for the Lord. This is our time. It is our generation.
I am convinced that there is much work to be done. There are many needs to be met. The people of God are to be set apart in holiness. We must seek to be used of God in His glory to accomplish the work of the Great Commission. God’s plan is to make disciples of all the nations. We are to be part of the work. We are to be used of God to do His will. That is the charge of the church at this hour. It is the charge of each one of us at this hour. Let us go forth in the unity of the Spirit, in the power of the Lord, and proclaim the good news of the Gospel to the world. God is bringing about the reunion of His church. We are going to celebrate that.

Deep in the ocean's abyss, where light never penetrates, a secluded group of mountainous, sunless coral reefs has been discovered. Vast undersea landscapes that are only reachable by the most advanced submarines, at a depth of two miles, give way to a colorful seascape that even the most hardened scuba divers will struggle to find. A truly special ecosystem, the reef was created by one of the most successful animals on the planet, the sea cucumber.
The discovery of the seamount was made during a 10-day voyage to the northern Caribbean waters of Dominican Republic, using an exceptionally advanced undersea vehicle (USV) called Tiburon. The submersible, one of four in the world, was designed to be capable of diving to depths of two miles, and was sent on an expedition to explore and study the ocean floor to the depths of 1,600 feet (500 meters). The organization behind the operation was Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego.
The discovery of a sunless coral seamount, one never seen before, on the seafloor was unexpected. Discovery of the seamount and its ecosystem is exciting, yet the actual environment may be unhealthy. The question is, can the sunless ecosystem sustain the ocean's life?
The seamount had been a closely-guarded secret for a long time, with the previous knowledge of its location classified.
At a depth of 1,800 feet (550 meters), the dark coral seamount's upper reaches of vegetation create a tunnel-like cover to shelter a thick and abundant ecosystem of biological activity, creating a habitat similar to the sunlit coral reefs. A seamount like this had never been seen before. The formations are an unusual type of coral reef that can only be found in very few parts of the ocean, and are generally harsh to explore as they are dark and mostly unreachable with limited access. There are only four of these seamounts found anywhere in the world, and this one was thought to be one of them.
Studies done on the dark coral seamount were published on October 18, 2012, in the peer-reviewed scientific journal, Science, authored by leading scientists from Scripps Oceanography, and led by Dr. Paulyn Cartwright, a researcher at Scripps Oceanography and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Dr. Cartwright has been examining these sunless ecosystems since 2006.
During the expedition, the coral seamount was explored using a variety of submersible equipment. A series of dives was made using Tiburon, an untethered submersible that can dive to a maximum depth of 6,600 feet (2,000 meters).
To map and study the seafloor, the USV used a 3-D photographic sonar, an acoustic Doppler current profiler, a microbial sampling instrument, and a high-definition video camera. In addition, the seafloor was photographed in order to document what was being found.
The biodiversity of the seamount was extremely high. The seamount was believed to be in an undisturbed, but nutrient poor, sunless ecosystem.
The expedition revealed a previously unknown community of coral species living in association with unusual and colorful sponges, filter-feeding worms, giant, glass-like jellies, and the sandy sea floor, where spotted moray eels hide in the sand.
The report says that the formation of coral growth on the seamount was sustained by excrement and other organic waste from fish and other marine creatures. Coral formations had been discovered on the seafloor in an environment depleted of light and photosynthetic energy. A year later, using video footage collected during the expedition, a team of biologists made another startling discovery. On a subsea mountain at a depth of 1,800 feet (550 meters) in the Caribbean, they found a seamount, previously classified as sunless, that was teeming with life.
It turns out that the ocean's sunlight doesn't always stop at the surface. In fact, sunlight shines deeper than you'd ever think, to levels that are as much as 60 percent of that found at the surface. The sunlight shines down to this depth because of nutrient-rich particles that float freely in the water. These miniscule particles, called phytoplankton, are the result of the decomposition of the skeletal remains of living plankton and other sea creatures.
As with any ecosystem, life depends on photosynthesis. Food for the coral comes from small particles of phytoplankton that enter the coral's mouth in order to feed on them.
This leads to the question as to what a dark coral reef is. This type of reef only uses sunlight when it's directly shining on the reef, which happens rarely. When the sun isn't shining, these sunless coral reefs survive off of minerals and nutrients from the ocean.
Can a sunless coral reef sustain life?
As a thought experiment, consider a sunless moon base, similar to the one we might envision with the preservation of Earth for future generations. A moon base would be very similar to sunless reefs that are untouched by the sun's light. The base would have to work on a system of nutrients and sustaining life through technology that can provide food and energy.
For a moon base to sustain life and be able to thrive, it would have to be self-sufficient, meaning that no outside supplies would be required. This would be very much like sunless reefs, which have to be self-sufficient because they aren't connected to nutrient-rich surface waters. A sunless moon base would have to use technology to provide nutrients in order to maintain life on the moon.
Sunless reefs, though they exist, do not represent all coral reefs. Only a few exist on the ocean floor.
The coral reefs that are lightless are generally sunless coral reefs that are untouched by sunlight because they are located in deep, dark sea trenches and formations.
However, some of the coral reefs that are well-known are sunless because they are untouched by light. There are also some that have adapted to living with little sunlight.
Little sunlight
Some sunless reefs form as a result of a lack of nutrients and/or sunlight. These reefs have adapted to live in an environment that lacks sunlight, but still have a healthy amount of nutrients.
Such reefs, though they exist, are generally not very common. They are found in places where there is less sunlight than is available at the surface of the ocean.
Many types of coral live on these reefs. They are all very adaptable to these conditions.
There is a scientific reason for sunless coral reefs. They are sunless because they are located under the surface of the water. The reason they are sunless is that they are at depths where sunlight cannot penetrate.
In order to see the coral, you must dive to a depth where the water is deeper than where you can see the coral. You cannot get to the coral without getting into the water. This means that the coral is not visible to humans.
For example, coral reefs that are in the open ocean cannot be seen. You cannot get to the coral unless you are in the water. The coral is not visible to humans, so the reef is considered to be sunless.
Sunless reefs can be very big, and they can extend for many miles. They have been described as being as large as islands and as big as mountains. They are found in all kinds of places, from the Caribbean to the Pacific, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.
These coral reefs can be hundreds of miles long, and they are often very shallow. Because they are so large, they can be seen from above. They can be seen on satellite images.
Sunless coral reefs are sunless because they are sunless coral reefs. They are made up of coral that has not been exposed to sunlight. They are not sunless because they are darker than other coral reefs.
Sunless coral reefs have very little light.
Sunless coral reefs are a very big problem. They are one of the biggest threats to coral reefs. They are caused by ocean acidification. They are caused by a change in the amount of CO2 in the air.
The reason that sunless coral reefs are so serious is that they are so large. They are large because they are very shallow. The coral has been growing for thousands of

The jazz musician's melody filled the air with the syncopation of a Dixieland swinger, but also in the clacking of typewriters as some writers researched. The rhythm of the crowd and the city was the same as always, of people walking in opposite directions and across the street, rushing here and there, avoiding others as they walked by as if all they had to do was jump the curb and they'd go from a single file line to two or three people deep.
A newspaper reporter from the _Post_ , Ben Cooper, walked the streets of Manhattan, trying to get a handle on where Jack Welch fit in. He stopped for lunch at a nice restaurant in Chelsea, and read in the _Times_ that Welch, the famed CEO of General Electric, had become the highest paid executive in the country, with a salary that included compensation and stock options that was over $200 million.
Cooper couldn't believe how far Welch had come since a decade before, when he was a washout and was run out of General Electric, the nation's most valuable company, by Jack St. Clair "Stretch" Whitacre, Welch's predecessor. Whitacre was also a big man and had his own problems; he'd faced charges of lying to Congress and insider trading, and he'd paid $14 million in fines and fees.
Still, Cooper knew what people with an ax to grind thought about Welch. They believed Welch drove GE and other American companies into the ground to get the compensation he was awarded. They said that the stockholders should have a say in who received a $200 million package and that people should look at what Welch had done and decide whether it was worth the cost.
"I'm just trying to make sense of what he did and where he fits in this market," Cooper said to the waiter, who delivered his steak and fries. He poured a second cup of coffee and dialed, hoping someone would be able to answer his question.
Geoffrey Moore stepped out of a cab in front of the Colonnade Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, across the street from the White House, and a well-dressed man greeted him. The man opened the door and Moore walked into a long white marble corridor with black-and-white tile floor, empty except for a guard in a dark blue uniform, arms crossed, at the end of the hall. A bodyguard followed Moore.
"Who is this?" Moore asked.
"The President," the man answered. "You're to report to Room 103 for a meeting."
"I'll be right there," Moore said.
The hallway was dark and quiet except for the soft footsteps of Moore's shoes. He paused to look at the flags, which flew over the White House and hung from the ceiling, to imagine what it was like to run a country that wasn't supposed to be able to get in the way of business. There were so many people that thought they knew what should happen next, but sometimes Moore had to ask himself if any of them knew anything about running a business.
A man in a suit and tie was waiting in Room 103, with his elbows resting on his desk, and his hands propped under his chin. The door opened, and Moore stepped in, smiling, as if he didn't know what to say. The man nodded and Moore sat down in the chair in front of the desk. The man stepped to the side of the desk, and an assistant handed him a glass of water and handed Moore a glass as well.
"The way I understand it, Mr. Moore, you've done some work for the government. We'd like to keep you as a consultant," the President said. "The amount of money that the government has to spend is nothing compared to the amount that people want to make. The only thing we can do is not restrict the way that they do business. We don't like to interfere with markets, because we know that the market, more often than not, makes the right choice."
Moore nodded. He drank some water and the President continued.
"We know you're going to make a lot of money. I want to encourage you to invest in the stock market. I want you to be part of the American dream, and I want everyone else to be able to enjoy it as well. The government is working very hard to create an economy where people are more interested in what they can make, rather than what the government gives them. People will be able to make money if they're smart, and take risks. A risk is what they're supposed to be looking for when they're investing. It makes them grow. It's what makes our country strong. Don't believe in what you read in the papers; it's hard to make sense of the economic news. Do what you do well and make money."
Moore stood up and shook the President's hand.
"Thank you," Moore said.
"Thank you for your time, Mr. Moore."
And as he walked out of the room, he heard the President say to someone else, "What about this software guy?"
He was gone, but as he walked down the hall, he thought about what he should do. He had a new chance to do something about money. He could make a lot of money, and hopefully he could help others. He was in the right place at the right time. He'd been able to survive by selling his book and following his ideals about success. He felt like he was living the American dream.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Samantha Becker was back in New York after her father's funeral and back at work at her office at the house at 62 Broadway. She was looking at the piles of mail on her desk and considered what to do with them. She knew that it was her job to go through the mail. She picked up the letters and walked to the door that led out of her office and into the house. She opened the door and started down the wide hallway toward her father's office.
She remembered that she needed to go through her father's office to find the security key, because she needed to get into his office and change the lock. She stepped into his office, and a yellow light was still shining on his desk, but the light in the room was off. She walked to the desk, and she felt the bumps and holes on the floor, the places where the drawer handles had been. She moved to his desk, touched the yellow light switch and it came on. She stood there, in the beam of light, and looked around the room. She imagined all the days that her father spent at this desk and how, at times, it was hard for her to walk into this room. Now it was her job to take care of this room and, as she walked around the desk, she saw the lock.
She walked out of the office, back down the hallway and through the door at the end of the hallway. She unlocked the door and opened it, and the sound of the door closing behind her was loud and dampened her step.
She knew she had to change the key to the door so no one could come in without her permission. She thought about what would happen if someone did try to enter the house; it would take a long time for her to be able to call the police or someone else to help. She'd have to find another way, and for the time being, she'd have to find a way to keep people from coming into the house. She had to think about what her next steps would be. She started to cry.
"Sam," the manservant said, his voice sounding from the end of the hallway. "I've been waiting for you. Can we talk?"
Samantha wiped her eyes and she stood up. She took a breath and walked down the hallway to where the manservant was waiting for her. She had to know if he was someone who would help her. She stepped to the side of the door and the door opened, and she walked out into the hallway. The manservant stepped back from the door, and she could see the long white marble hallway with the black-and-white tile floor and the guard standing in front of her.
"Are you the bodyguard?" she asked.
"Yes, I'm Harvey Collier. I'm your father's bodyguard," he said, smiling.
"And can I trust you?" she asked.
"You can trust me," he said.
"Okay," she said. "Can I ask you something?"
"Sure," he said.
"My dad always said that he was going to leave me something in his will. Can I find out what it was?"
"You can find out," Collier said. "I'll tell you what I know."
Samantha nodded. "How much time do I have to find out what I need to know?" she asked.
"Your father's funeral was yesterday," Collier said. "The government has an investigation into your father's death, and they'll be able to have access to any records that they need

At the annual ghost convention, a friendly spirit wins the award for "Least Haunting," causing her to see if she can up her game. Several spirits who've become bored with haunting decide to play pranks.Meanwhile, Tucker is tricked into giving a speech at the convention, though it's kind of an epic fail. The spirits join in the fun as they wreak havoc everywhere.This story was originally written for Ghosties, one of the anthologies released by Shannon Delany. This story was published in the anthology Haunted Halloween.

A group of penguins decides to start their own tropical resort in Antarctica, featuring such luxury amenities as warm tropical weather, swinging coconuts and pink bubbles.
But just when the Club has really begun to attract some penguins, there is a sudden polar vortex (yes, there can be polar vortexes in Antarctica) that makes everything freeze, including the tropical decorations, which all turn to ice! What will it take to get the water back up to tropical temperatures again?
Tropical Resort Penguins: Beach Party Pandemonium is an interactive role-playing game for 3-7 year-olds (potty training encouraged). Your little actor will be guided through the entire experience by the Clubhouse Cat, who will keep track of what to do in each scene. A “Parent Assistant” will be available to help your child learn the game and answer any questions as they arise.

The scientist's groundbreaking discovery challenged the established understanding of embryonic development, but his methods still had critics. Some scholars objected to his use of sperm to extract chambers from a fertilized egg. In 1880, seven scientists filed a petition with the British government to remove the Committee of the Privy Council for the Regulation of Intellectual Property, the scientific equivalent of today's patent court, from reviewing the patent application. The scientists argued that his method was a scientific discovery and not a practical invention. He was granted a patent, but it was soon nullified on a technicality: He had listed a summary of his work and not a specific description of the method he was patenting. The committee agreed, and awarded him a second patent, with the details of his method included.
The value of the patent lies in a mathematical calculation that works out to $24 million. Even if he had not used the funds to bring a successful product to market, Lister's patent has been worth tens of millions because it extended the initial period of exclusivity granted to patent holders, from 14 years to 17 years, after which a patent enters the public domain. The patent, which expired in 1909, generated royalty payments that have continued to be paid by companies making and selling variations of Lister's products.
The controversy over Lister's patent isn't unusual. One of the most lucrative patents ever sold involved polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a DNA amplification technique that has been used to detect viral and bacterial infections, screen blood donations, and test athletes for illegal steroid use. The patent was granted in 1989 to three American scientists: Kary Mullis, the inventor, and a team at Cetus Corporation. Since then, more than 100 companies have licensed the patent, and several leading pharmaceutical companies have introduced PCR-based tests to the market.
For years, American industry has been confronted with concerns about the patent system, often framed as whether it is fair and encourages innovation. Today, we know the patent system is riddled with inefficiency and poorly designed to promote innovation, even as many patents, like Lister's, can reap huge benefits for inventors.
The high costs associated with patent litigation are often cited as a reason for the system's flaws. In fact, they're the result of a shortsighted attempt to resolve disputes when the system was first enacted. Rather than relying on courts to adjudicate patent disputes, Congress set up a court of special jurisdiction, the Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Created in 1984, the PTAB consolidates two legal mechanisms to review patents: reexamination and inter partes review.
Reexamination was created by the court in 1980 as a way to force inventors to defend their patents in court or lose them. The process was cumbersome, costly, and rarely used, since patents holders had only a short period of time to reply to patent office rejections. This led to a backlog of about 10,000 cases waiting to be heard at the time Congress passed a law to replace reexamination with inter partes review, a procedure that prevents inventors from obtaining patents before they publicly disclose their inventions. That seems like a good policy—but it has actually caused the opposite of what Congress wanted.
To understand how, it's important to distinguish between patents on inventions and those on processes. Patents can be granted to protect an invention that results from a process, or an invention that is part of a process. For example, I might invent a machine that holds a pair of eyeglasses to help keep a child's hands clean as they eat, and then apply for a patent. A year later, I might go on the road and sell my invention at trade shows. If a buyer wants to manufacture my machine, I would sign a contract with them to allow them to produce my invention. In this case, I would have a patent on an invention, and my buyer would get a license to manufacture that invention.
A patent on an invention protects my inventor's rights over the invention itself, while a patent on a process protects my inventor's rights over the process, including the right to prevent others from replicating the invention using the process. Even if you can replicate the invention, that doesn't mean you can use the patented process to replicate it, so you would still need a license.
In the above example, the buyer's license covers the invention; I retain the right to license anyone else to use the process. Because licenses typically cover only the invention, buyers would be willing to pay a lot less to buy a patent, in essence buying only the right to manufacture the invention rather than the patent on the invention. This would put me in a stronger negotiating position.
That is why patents on inventions tend to be more valuable than patents on processes: License fees are higher for inventions than for processes because the inventor can offer a license to the process only to those who will buy the invention. The example of Lister's patent shows why the only way the licensing model can be sustainable is if the patent holder continues to invent or invent new inventions, or license the invention to others to manufacture.
But that would not be the case with a patent on a process, since that patent would only protect the right to use the process, not to invent, and therefore would be useless for licensing purposes. This is why the 1984 legislation that replaced reexamination with inter partes review creates a perverse incentive for inventors to not reveal what is in their patent applications to the public.
In my eyeglasses example, the patent on the invention that results from a process can be used to sell the process itself. This would make my patent on a process worth less than my patent on an invention, but my patent on the process would still be valuable because I could license others to use the process. This discourages inventors from revealing what is in their applications, which is exactly what the legislators intended. And to prevent patent applicants from inventing around the process, the PTAB will allow patent holders to file challenges and claim there is something in the application that can't be found in prior art.
Licensing inventions would be inefficient, the PTAB would be ineffective, and courts would be overwhelmed with challenges, but the incentive to invent has not been damaged. The patent system is no longer about bringing inventions to market—it's now about creating a patent bubble.
A patent bubble is a market in which prices exceed fair value, which allows inventors to extract rents for rights that have little intrinsic value. Patent owners can't generate any income unless they license their patent, which makes the income the patent generates in future years worth more than the cost of the patent itself. The value of a patent bubble is usually determined by the strength of its underlying market, which is not the same as the underlying market for patents.
As long as patent holders can impose arbitrary fees, even after the expiration of a patent, by charging a higher fee if a license is granted at all, a patent bubble will exist. This has long been a challenge in the industry. If the invention is patented, the owner will demand an unreasonably high price for a license, which may prevent the product from being introduced to the market. Or if the owner charges too little, there will be no demand to license the invention, leaving it in the patent holder's hands. Companies that have to work around the invention are stuck between the two, which is what created the patent bubble.
As long as patents continue to be granted in ways that lead to unreasonably high prices, we can expect another patent bubble to form, which will once again stymie the development of new products and slow down innovation. This isn't surprising, since the incentives have never been about developing new inventions. They were established to benefit inventors, but we've gradually lost track of the original intentions of the patent system.
The current system is designed to benefit only one group: patent holders. Inventors get paid, but only because someone pays them. The court system is overwhelmed by challenges to patents, and the system itself has become dysfunctional, leading to an increase in the cost of research and development. As a result, inventors have no incentive to innovate—they're paid to do so, but it's not worth it.
In the years since Lister's patent expired, advances in medicine have significantly improved our ability

In the early hours of the morning, the roaring rush of the metro and the falling rain announce to everyone that the evening has ended. The pine tree of Kreupotkina Square is like an oasis of calm in the center of the raging city. Or is it an oasis of life? At the intersection of Streets Kazakovskaya and Danilovskaya, it seems as if the perception of the city disappears, leaving only the tree itself. The silhouette of the pine tree seems to be immersed in the waves of evening lights. But it is not only the evening that becomes magic: time itself breaks apart and becomes as agile as a child: it flies, it stops, it mixes up, and then it merges with something else. The personality of a pine tree is not the only one that emerges from the image of the surrounding space. The rhythm of the evening dictates the metamorphoses of the tree and its traces, which, as it seems to me, slowly turn into figures of the deceased: maybe it's memories of someone who used to walk under these trees.
It would be wrong to focus only on the abstraction of the image. If we search the lighting of the trees, we can feel the breeze's sigh and the trees' rustling. We can feel the way the branches bend under the weight of rain and the wind.
We can feel the mixture of coldness, striving for warmth, and yearning to be free. All of the above, both in this moment and in the depths of memory, is the poetry of the Kreupotkina Square and the atmosphere of evening St. Petersburg.

The vintage car raced down the open highway. “Ahhh, the feel of the wind whipping across my face.”
The Mustang’s driver slowed, taking notice of a road sign that read “Quarantine 100 miles.”
That didn’t mean much to the driver. He continued on down the highway. But then the next sign read “One-week Quarantine. Any illegal passage will result in death.”
Yikes. What was going on here?
“This is crazy. I’m getting out of here.”
The car turned back and headed for the nearest exit.
It took all night. The drivers refused to stop, insisting on driving all the way back home.
“I thought the virus was contained. What’s with all this?”
“Same here,” said another driver. “I’m not getting out of my car for any roadblocks.”
As they drove, other cars passed by, but they all continued on, too, avoiding the quarantine checkpoints.
Things started to get a little paranoid. Two cars lurked around the bend, each heading in the opposite direction, and the drivers never said a word to each other.
“How are you, Mr. Driver?”
“Fine. And you?”
Suddenly the car was pelted with bullets.
“Oh my God!” The driver was punched in the face, but he kept his focus on the road, rattling off “Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!” over and over.
Bullets kept flying. The car swerved out of control. The driver screamed as it careened off the road, shattering into thousands of pieces.
The other driver wasn’t a very good shot, so he didn’t hit anyone else.
As he drove along, a thought entered his mind. He put his foot down on the gas pedal. “Let’s get out of here,” he said.
Even though he hated her, Nick was curious about the frog in the lab at OmniCorp.
His supervisor explained that they wanted to clone a clone of the frog so they could understand how they worked. But, since Nick had never been in a lab before, he wondered if they were really going to create the clone.
“If they were going to, they’d do it in private,” he said.
“Don’t be silly,” said his boss. “If the frog was going to be a clone, it would have to be made in public.”
“If they want to make a clone, they don’t need a special room. They just need a lab and a computer.”
“What if they want to clone a frog?” asked Nick.
“That’s crazy. I’ve never heard of anyone doing that. They can just put the frog in a jar and wait until it turns back into a frog.”
Nick rolled his eyes.
The next day, he noticed the door to the lab was closed. He went inside and saw the frog, curled up into a ball.
“What are you doing?” asked Nick.
“I’m trying to clone myself,” said the frog.
“You can’t clone yourself,” said Nick. “Why would you want to?”
The frog shrugged.
“If you want to clone yourself, you have to wait until I get done.”
“Huh? How can I clone myself?”
“Well, you have to have a friend,” said the frog.
“A friend? Okay, you have a friend.”
“And, what’s your name?”
“My name is Nick. Nice to meet you.”
“Nick? That’s a funny name.”
“Yeah. I know. I’ve always hated it. But I have a friend who’s named ‘Nick’ and she really likes it.”
“Wow. What’s the name of her friend?”
“Her name is Helen, but I prefer to call her Hellen.”
“I’m calling Helen Hellen now. Hi, Hellen. Can I borrow your name?”
“Sure. I don’t mind.”
“That’s great. How about you, Nick?”
“Well, Helen, I don’t have a name.”
“That’s weird, Nick. I have a name.”
“Yeah. Nick. I’m called Nick.”
“Nick. Nick, is that you?”
“Yes, it is. I’m me.”
“Well, then, Nick, I guess I’ll see you later.”
“Sure thing. Bye-bye, Helen.”
He wandered around the lab, looking for some other place to go. Then he saw the door to the back room. “Perfect,” he thought.
Once inside, he locked the door. He put the frog into a jar and hung it from the ceiling. He opened a window and turned on a ventilator. Then he sat down at his desk and started working.
He wrote on the computer and, then, put it down. He got up, went over to the computer and typed something else. He looked at the frog. It was looking at him.
“Hey, frog,” he said.
The frog didn’t answer.
“Um, frog, I need to know something.”
The frog said nothing.
“Hey, frog, it’s Nick. I need you to answer something for me.”
“No. Answer it!”
“Fine. How did you clone yourself?”
“You don’t know. I can tell you. You can’t clone yourself. If you want to clone yourself, you have to have a friend.”
“Ah-ha! You mean you’re my friend?”
“Yeah, I am. Why else would I tell you this?”
“But, I don’t understand. How does that work?”
“Well, you have to tell your friend the thing you want to clone.”
“Okay. So, I say that I want to clone myself. What do I do then?”
“Tell your friend you want to clone yourself. If you’re telling someone else that you want to clone yourself, they’re your friend. If they’re your friend, they’re telling you that you want to clone yourself.”
“And, then, I have to wait until they tell me that I want to clone myself.”
“That’s right. That’s right. I’m telling you that you want to clone yourself.”
“Yes, I do. I want to clone myself.”
“Good. Now, I need you to go outside. There’s something I need to tell you. You can come back after you tell me. I’ll be waiting here.”
“But I can’t leave. I have a virus.”
“Oh, I see. Well, I guess I’ll just have to tell you then.”
The frog went outside. Nick was sitting at the desk, staring at the computer screen. He typed something, but he didn’t know what it was.
“Hey, frog. What’s going on?”
“I told you I was going to clone myself.”
“Well, I guess I did. But you didn’t say I was my friend.”
“Oh. Well, what’s going on?”
“I’m trying to clone myself. I need you to tell me if I need to do it. I can’t tell you if I need to do it.”
“Why not? You know you need to do it. Just say it. You want to clone yourself.”
“Okay. Fine. I want to clone myself.”
“Well, what are you waiting for? Go outside and do it.”
“Oh. You want to do it. Go outside and do it.”
The frog left the room and the door closed behind him. Nick went to the window and opened the ventilator. The air began to whirl around the room.
“Hello?” Nick said.
He put the frog back in the jar and hung it on the ceiling. He started typing something else on the computer. Then, he looked at the screen and read the words.
He didn’t know what it meant. He wasn’t even sure he had made it.
But he knew something. He knew he had to get out of there.
She was riding in the car, talking to her friends. “Did you see those two guys in the car behind me? They were riding their bikes and then, all of a sudden, they jumped off of them. I mean, I couldn’t believe it.”
“Yeah, I saw them, too. I thought they were going to hit me.”
“Yeah. What do you think they’re doing?”
“I think they’re ghosts.”
“They were both wearing black. And, they looked like they were on a mission. They were riding their bikes to get somewhere. And, when they jumped off, they just kept going.”
“They could have been ghosts, but they could have also been humans.”
“Yeah, but humans can’t jump. Only ghosts can do

Exploring the depths of the ocean reveals an entirely new and mysterious world. It is abundant in life forms that are strange, exotic, and at times horrific to humans.
While there is much to learn about the ocean, scientists only explore a tiny part of it and the vast majority remains untouched and unseen. Scientists estimate that only four percent of the ocean has been explored and mapped and that the ocean contains far more unexplored territory than unexplored land.
The deep ocean is a challenging environment for humans to explore. Many of its depths are beyond the reach of conventional human-operated exploratory crafts. The topography, temperature, and physical properties of the ocean floor vary greatly in its depths. For example, in shallow areas, the ocean floor is often very flat, but in deeper areas, the ocean floor is often mountainous with slopes of up to 30 degrees or more. As a result, exploration of the deep ocean requires a wide variety of instruments.
The maps of the ocean floor are crucial for monitoring changes, such as natural disasters and climate change, or for use in other commercial and scientific activities such as fishing and drilling.
The Hakatazu Mission
The Hakatazu mission of the Japanese Space Agency’s Ocean Observation Research Promotion Center (OPC) is to use a combination of sophisticated, next-generation instruments to map the ocean floor around Japan.
Ningen fishing boat used for the Hakatazu mission
OPC conducts research to gain a deeper understanding of the oceans, particularly the deep sea. OPC uses several oceanographic vessels, but the primary vessel is a Japanese ningen (人人?) or humanoid fishing boat. The ningen vessel looks like a typical fishing boat from the outside, but it is much more sophisticated inside. OPC can use the ningen boat to explore deep ocean areas that are beyond the reach of conventional human-operated exploration vehicles.
Figure 1. Plan of ningen mission
Hakatazu Mission Summary
Soon after the original Hakatazu mission was launched in March of 2009, it became apparent that the vehicle was drifting far beyond its original design limits. A decision was made to discontinue the mission.
The mission was planned for an approximately 600 km journey from Nagasaki Prefecture (Nagashima Island) to the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture in Japan. The ningen boat would sail north, pass by the Muroto Peninsula, cross the shipping lanes in the Tsugaru Strait, cross the Japan Trench, and finally pass by the Oshika Peninsula. In addition to its exploratory mission, the ningen boat would provide useful data to the fishing industry.
Figure 2. Nagashima Island, Nagasaki Prefecture
The two main instruments of the Hakatazu mission are:
Multibeam sonar system,
Downward-looking echosounder.
The multibeam sonar is a special form of sonar that is used to provide very high-resolution information about the ocean floor. The downward-looking echosounder is a special form of sonar that is used to provide information about the vertical distribution of ocean floor types. The ningen boat was equipped with additional instruments, such as light and video cameras and a survey tether, to provide auxiliary data to supplement the information provided by the two main instruments.

Hakatazu Mission Results
The multibeam sonar collected data for 83 hours, covering about 2,000 km of ocean terrain. During the first half of the voyage, the Hakatazu ningen boat covered the Japan Trench area, crossing the Tsugaru Strait. The second half of the voyage occurred in the Oshika Peninsula area.
The downward-looking echosounder collected data for about 50 hours. It was used to explore about 400 km of ocean terrain, including about 60 km of Tsugaru Strait and the Oshika Peninsula.

The multibeam sonar system has produced incredible data, but the Hakatazu mission quickly became a disaster for OPC. It was a failure from the outset because the mission was poorly planned. For example, the instrument was equipped to collect exploration data, but the exploration was poorly planned. The Hakatazu mission clearly shows the important role that proper planning plays in successful ocean exploration.

Figure 12. Multiple errors in Hakatazu mission planning
There were numerous errors in planning the Hakatazu mission. The biggest error was not knowing how far OPC wanted to travel from Nagashima Island to the Oshika Peninsula. There were also errors in planning the route of the ningen boat.
Figure 13. Shipwreck on the Nagashima Island
OPC had to face the potential of losing a research vessel when the mission ended in a shipwreck on Nagashima Island (see Fig. 14).
Figure 14. Location of Nagashima Island in Nagasaki Prefecture
Figure 15. Hakatazu mission after 5 days
The Hakatazu mission was going according to plan until the ningen boat drifted beyond its design limits.
OPC made two significant mistakes in the Hakatazu mission. They did not have a rigorous plan for traveling to the Oshika Peninsula and they did not have a rigorous plan for navigating in the open sea.
These mistakes were due to their inexperience and naivety. In addition, they did not know how long the mission would take to complete or how far it would travel from Nagashima Island.
In the early days of the voyage, the Hakatazu mission traveled through Nagashima Island, crossed the Tsugaru Strait, and passed by the Muroto Peninsula. Then, on the fifth day of the mission, it drifted to Oshika Peninsula. This location can be seen in Fig. 15, which shows the location of Nagashima Island in Nagasaki Prefecture and the route of the ningen boat during the Hakatazu mission.
The data collected during the Hakatazu mission were valuable. They provided useful information about the ocean floor near Nagashima Island and Tsugaru Strait.
The most significant findings were the oceanic plates that formed over the seafloor. Figure 16 shows the result of analyzing the multibeam sonar data.
Figure 16. Oceanic plate mapping
The oceanic plate mapping shows the direction of the sea floor at the mid-oceanic ridge between the Eurasian and Pacific plates. This was the second-longest segment of the voyage, from Nagashima Island to the Oshika Peninsula. The overall duration of the mission was 10 days, from March 19 to March 29.
Oceanic plates form over the seafloor when two tectonic plates collide with one another. The resulting oceanic plate is a large plate that is typically several kilometers thick and hundreds of kilometers long. The oceanic plates formed during the Hakatazu mission are not the first oceanic plates to be formed. They are also not the first oceanic plates to have been mapped. However, the oceanic plates are the first oceanic plates to have been mapped in the area where they were formed.
This discovery was important because it provided evidence that the ocean floor had changed over time, from a flat surface to

The winding path through the mountains offered no solace from the cold and rain. It plastered her black dress to her legs, and she shivered despite the promise of more clothes at the end of her journey. A thin, black veil concealed her face and features, though that was not the intention. In truth, she needed to keep the chill off of her forehead.
Tears clouded her eyes, and she tried not to let them fall. She'd cried enough already.
"How much farther?" she asked.
"Just a bit," Flynn answered.
"Do you know how many cries that makes this afternoon?"
He pulled off his hat and then reached into the pocket of his coat, fishing out a kerchief. With a whispered word, it changed into a clean one. He handed it to her.
"I'm all right. It's you who should be crying."
He said nothing, and they walked in silence a moment.
"I thought if I could convince my family to let me finish the degree, my father wouldn't insist I marry," she continued. "I thought with a degree, my prospects would improve."
"You've already married a doctor."
"Not a good one, and certainly not a woman."
"Hardly that, but still."
"I suppose I'll live, and it won't be so bad."
"You have prospects. The doc-o-tor. He's coming for you."
"When the quake struck, he got knocked out and thrown against the wall. He's in a bad way. I need to be there."
"Don't you want to marry and leave your family's shack?"
"No, and that's why I won't marry."
"You can't tell your family."
"They wouldn't understand. What would they think of me? I'm old enough to be married, and yet, here I am alone, without a husband and without any prospects."
"You could always leave. Go and visit your sister and find a way to start over. There are options for you."
"I don't want to leave. This is home, and my sister has her own family to care for."
He took her hand and led her around the hill to a wagon he'd parked beside the trail. They took their seats, and he put the horses into motion, the wagon bouncing and rattling until they reached the main road. The carpet of rain grew thicker and more intense.
He stopped, and they both stepped out. Wet branches slapped them as they ran.
"Where are we going?" she asked.
"To shelter. We'll be better off."
"You can't bring me into your home, not after what you said earlier."
"Not into my home. Just to a place we can keep out of the rain until the downpour is done."
He had a plan, and he intended to see it through, whatever it took. The fact that he'd included her in it... Well, that was another matter entirely. She'd have to give him that. He'd been kind to her, and now she owed him a favor.
After another two or three miles of driving and riding, they finally reached their destination. He helped her from the wagon and handed her up into the covered porch of an old white farmhouse. No light glowed within, and the door remained locked.
"Where are we?"
"My friends, Alice and Bess, live in this old house. I've never been to visit them, but they helped me once. You need shelter from the rain. If you don't mind, I'll leave you with them for the night."
"We'll both be wet until morning."
"Yes, but the fire will be warm, and it'll give us something to talk about. I'll sleep out here on the porch."
She stood silent, her mind searching for answers she didn't want to face.
"It's all right, Drummond," she whispered.
He climbed down from the wagon, and she heard him go to the door and knock. After a moment, he pounded again. She waited, watching him from under the veil, her heart thudding in her chest. He drew a deep breath, and then he set to work, forcing open the door.
"Drummond?" the voice inside asked. "Who is it?"
He spoke, and a moment later, the porch door swung inward. A woman stepped into the light, eyes wide with surprise and a dark-red bonnet hiding most of her face.
He pulled back the veil from her face, letting it drop to her lap.
"Flynn," the woman said, letting out a soft gasp.
"Alice. Bess," he said, and then motioned for her to follow him inside.
"Please, stay here," he said to Flynn. "I'll be right back."
She hesitated, then moved forward into the cool house and shook the water from her clothes.
He'd done this, despite the risk, despite the fact that he had no idea if they'd survived the quake. She found herself grateful for his willingness to help her, and in turn, she decided that there would be no harm in spending the night with two women she'd never met.
Alice was a petite woman who spoke in a soft, honeyed voice. Bess was younger, not quite out of childhood, and from the small smile she gave Flynn, he'd touched her, too. After a cup of tea and a meal of eggs and toast, they settled themselves around the fire.
"Flynn speaks of your qualifications," Alice said. "I assume you're studying medicine at the medical college."
"I'm in my last year," she said.
"I read about it in the newspaper. It's wonderful you've achieved something like that."
"I'm still not sure how I will work it all out, but that's what I've decided to do. I'll graduate, and then I'll try to put my knowledge to use."
"What of your family?"
"My parents are pastors, but they've traveled much of their lives, and so I don't see them often. I have a brother in the East, but I hardly know him."
"I understand," Alice said.
"There's a lady who died in the town across the mountain. The death occurred the day before the quake. Her daughter might have a job for me when I graduate."
"No doubt that will be the answer. One door closes, another opens."
She felt her cheeks heat at the wisdom of her aunt.
"I'm living in a cottage with my sister and her husband. My sister's pregnant, so I've promised to stay until the baby is born."
Alice smiled. "But you're living with your sister and her husband. I think you'll find a job, and you can begin saving your own money."
"There's a lot of history here. My aunt knows about it, but I don't know if I do."
"There is a real problem with scrofula in this town," Alice said. "That's a rather horrible disease, don't you think?"
"I am a physician."
"You're also a lady, and so you must find a husband. Do you believe in love?"
"Do you think you could find a way to give your love to a man you marry?"
"I suppose."
"Marriage isn't all bad, is it?"
She shook her head. "There's the law to consider. It's so hard to... But yes, I do love Flynn."
"Then that's something to build upon."
Alice settled her arm around Bess's shoulder, and Flynn got up and walked out to the porch. From there, he looked up and down the road, his hat in hand, his back straight and confident. She watched him and wanted to run to him, but there was a barrier she'd never been able to cross, a door that always seemed to be locked.
For a moment, she considered telling Alice and Bess what she did, that she'd been working for him, trying to make it possible for Flynn to save the day when she'd helped him set up the trip wire to catch the horse thieves. It was only part of her job, but she thought she might be able to explain that.
"I'm sorry to speak of it, but I'm worried about Flynn. He doesn't have much money."
"He has his land. That will always be there."
"What if something happens to him?"
"Then it will be up to you to survive."
She felt a frown cross her face. She wanted to ask questions and get answers, but she knew she'd been wrong to come to her aunt and cousin with her troubles.
"I'm so sorry, Flynn. What am I going to do?"

A squirrel with ambitions to become a gourmet chef starts a food blog, with the first entry about the turkey burger he was planning to make with his mum's recipe. The next day, his pants are spilling out with the cooked burger and he knows he has to get a job - preferably a rich one - if he is to fulfil his dream.
Very enjoyable. A few surreal jokes that didn't hit quite as expected, but overall very humorous. The art is very stylish and well done.
Awesome! Loved the gags and the ending!
Is this a Halloween special?
A good animation style but overly time stamped. It seemed pretty random and it feels like there were a lot of ideas jammed into this short. I didn't really laugh at any of the jokes but I liked the art style.
I'm not sure if this short is saying anything, but it is still funny!
It has a very nice art style. The humor doesn't always hit, but its pretty funny. I loved the ending, everything ties together pretty well!
The pacing was a bit too quick for my taste, especially in the beginning of the short. Other than that, it was very enjoyable, funny and entertaining.
I felt like there was a much better way to put the burger in his pants than what was done. I'd also suggest maybe toning down the music a bit, it was kinda overpowering to what's going on.
The gags, the art style and the charming story!
Just awesome! I laughed really hard. The ending was perfect!
I like it! The music is so cool.
Good luck for a job?
Thanks guys. To answer @Nevin: the music is a simple chip tune that I made a long time ago, but I'm glad you like it.

The old librarian discovered a forgotten letter between the pages of an old book and found a mysterious love story that captivated her imagination.
“The boy called Edwin Willam worked in the small library in her hometown. He was a good-natured, gregarious man who loved his job, and that’s why she didn’t think about the same old, boring books on her shelf.
One day a strange book came to the library and it was very different from the other books. It was old and battered, but the bookseller refused to sell it.
“This book is full of sentimentality,” he warned her.
He scoffed at the idea that sentimentality could be a work of art.
She thought he was overreacting, but she promised to return it.
She took the book home and read it.
The book wasn’t a book at all, it was a note written by Edwin Willam to a woman he loved very much.
He was heartbroken when the woman disappeared, and he poured out his feelings to her as he wrote his letter.
“Dearest Violet. I don’t know how I feel, but I know I can’t help it. I don’t know how you feel, but I do know you feel a lot for me. I can’t believe you don’t feel that way, but I do know you feel a lot for me.
His letter ended and was closed.
“I’m going to cry,” she thought to herself and began to sob.
Edwin Willam fell in love with Violet because she was kind, honest, and a kind-hearted woman who never disappointed him.
Several years passed, and the old librarian lost contact with the old book. She returned to the bookstore and asked for the book, but the owner had moved to a new store.
One day, when she was reading a book in her library, she found a letter from Violet. She rushed to the street and discovered that her old friend had died, and Edwin Willam buried her in his backyard.
“I never knew I’d find a way to find her.
“I can’t believe she found a way to find me,” she thought.
Violet had always been a good friend, but he didn’t know it.
“But why did he love her?
Edwin Willam loved Violet because he was a good man. Violet was always willing to help others, and he never stopped being a good friend.
Violet was the only one who believed in him, and she was also the only one who truly loved him.
“I can’t believe I’m in love with her, but I’m in love with her,” he thought.
She cried as she read the letter and realized that Edwin Willam loved her as much as she loved him.
“Edwin Willam loved me. Violet loved me, but she loved Edwin Willam more. I never loved him, but now I do.
Violet’s note touched the old librarian’s heart and she found out she was in love with Edwin Willam.
“I’m in love with him,” she thought.
“I never thought I would feel this way. I didn’t think I’d find a way to find him.
The old librarian searched for Edwin Willam and realized that Violet had returned to him, but her heart was broken.
“Violet, I’m so sorry. You are so beautiful, but I can’t keep you. I’m so sorry.”
“I’m not sorry. I can’t stay. I love him, but I can’t stay. I love him.”
“I don’t know if I can love him. But I can love him.”
“I love him, but I can’t stay.”
Violet was sad, but she never regretted loving him.
She felt guilty for loving Edwin Willam, but it was too late for her.
“I’m going to write him a letter, but I can’t read it. I can’t read it.”
She never regretted loving Edwin Willam, and she never regretted loving Violet.
She knew she loved Edwin Willam, but she didn’t know how to express it.
Violet’s heart was broken, but she knew she loved him and she wanted to write a letter to Edwin Willam.
“Dear Edwin Willam,
“I never knew I’d find a way to find him. I never thought I’d be able to love you, but I do.
“But I can’t read it.
“I can’t love you.
“But I’m going to.
“I’m going to love you. I’m going to love you.
The old librarian felt guilty for loving Edwin Willam, but she knew she was in love with him.
She knew that Violet loved him, but she couldn’t read it. She could read it, but she couldn’t read it.
The letter was a confession of love.
The old librarian knew she was in love with Edwin Willam, but she didn’t know how to express it.
She was going to tell Edwin Willam that she loved him, but she couldn’t read the letter.
“I’m going to read it. I’m going to love him. I’m going to read it.”
Violet’s heart was broken, but she loved Edwin Willam, and she couldn’t express it.
“I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it.
“I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it.
“I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it.
“I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it.
“I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it. I can’t read it.
Violet’s heart was broken, but she knew she loved Edwin Willam, and she couldn’t express it.
She had never expressed her love to him before.
“But I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him.
The old librarian knew she loved Edwin Willam, but she didn’t know how to express it.
“I’m going to read it. I’m going to love him.
“I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him.
“I’m going to tell him.
The old librarian knew she loved Edwin Willam, and she knew she was going to tell him.
She knew she was going to tell him that she loved him, and she didn’t know how to tell him.
“I’m going to tell him.
“I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him.
“I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him.
“I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him. I’m going to tell him.

Jeremy and Alex take the third place prize at BarCampFood.
One of my favorite conferences has been sold. I'm assuming it was to pay for its 5-year tour of the world. Now, instead of being a conference with a small audience, it's going to be a big conference with a small audience. So, from now on, it's a traveling road show! Hooray. And they've gone digital.
There will be 400 attendees, but only 200 total tickets.
There will be a completely different list of speakers.
There will be a different venue and city for each conference.
I guess the organizers realized that I was the only one that liked BarCamp because it was local and I preferred the smallness of the events.
To any regular reader of TechBuzz, this is no surprise. For more than two years, BarCamp has disappointed me with one yearly conference. I didn't realize how disappointed I was until I read through the notes I took of the events. That's what I did with my review of BarCamp in 2007, BarCamp in 2008, BarCamp in 2009, and BarCamp in 2010. When I started noticing how the same people spoke each year, and how the same format was used each year, I started to worry that the event had jumped the shark. But they ignored the signs, and instead of killing the event, they figured out a way to make it big.
There's a difference between a successful event and a big event. They're not the same thing. Big events are popular, but successful events are great.
A successful event does everything right. There are great speakers who are super-motivating and inspiring. The event is simple but powerful. I get to know people, and learn things that aren't obvious from the surface. There are no big problems, just small solutions that people need help with. It's a good experience. And that's what BarCamp did until it stopped being local and it stopped being the community.
That was great. This is going to be a big show, full of great people, but all of them will have way too much to do. It will be crowded, there will be distractions, and it's unlikely that you'll be able to meet people. There are a lot of logistics to figure out, and a lot of tickets to sell, and a lot of people who want to come. It's an impossible task to make it local again.
And there are no details yet, so I don't know if they can pull it off. But it sure sounds great, and if I lived in LA, I'd probably attend. So, if you don't live in LA, and you've always wanted to attend, this might be your only chance. Maybe this is what BarCamp needed to do.
BarCamp is dead. Long live BarCamp.
There are only three slides you need to be successful with any presentation.
PowerPoint's designers put them at the very top of the presentation tools, and for good reason. Even if the presentation is boring, those slides alone can keep the audience awake. If you use them, they will think you know what you're doing.
By the time you get to the third slide, most audiences are too interested to care about how well you present the rest of your material. So, there's no reason to use boring PowerPoint graphics. And there are plenty of alternatives.
Maybe you've never been to a good presentation. Or maybe you're a professional presenter. Whatever the case, there are still a few principles that I would like to teach you.
If you present anything longer than 15 minutes, PowerPoint is an ineffective tool. Just speaking directly to your audience can be more engaging and productive. And if you must use PowerPoint, don't use the slides to repeat what you've already said. Instead, use the slides as a reminder to the audience of what you've already said. That is, use the slides to remind them of what they heard and not what they saw.
There's a principle of physics called entropy. If you know a little about physics, you know that entropy measures the natural disorder in the universe. It's the tendency for things to get in a state of more and more disorder. For example, a geyser of water is in a state of extreme disorder. It has nowhere to go but to be wasted. Like water, a good presentation starts in an ordered state and devolves into disorder as it progresses.
A story, or a song, or an article, or a book, is very orderly. The author has control over how much you know and how much you don't know. An interesting conversation starts off in an orderly state, and as the conversation progresses, it devolves into disorder. At the end, you're both saying things that you didn't know at the beginning of the conversation. That's why we like to listen to experts. They know more than we do, and therefore, they can explain to us things that we don't know. It's why we like to tell experts about our problems.
So, what about a PowerPoint presentation? First, there's the slides. They're created out of the orderly brain of the presenter. But, the slides are projected onto a screen for everyone to see. And as you present to everyone, the information flows from you to the audience. As it does, it passes through you, back to you, and to everyone else.
Because of this, a good presentation is controlled chaos. It starts off in an orderly state, but because there are so many people involved, it devolves into chaos by the end. You only have the ability to control the first 15 slides. The last 15 slides are out of your control, and as a result, you can't control the flow of the presentation.
Don't blame the system for not working, blame the way you use the system.
There are many ways to create a slide presentation. I use Keynote because it's the best Mac application. On Windows, I recommend PowerPoint. For web conferences, go to Slideshare.com and create a presentation.
When you're ready to present, make a copy of the presentation on a Mac or a PC. Or use Google Drive. Then load the slides into Keynote. On a Mac, you'll find yourself working in a familiar environment. On Windows, you'll be working in a familiar environment, but the interface will be a little different. For a web presentation, you'll be working in a familiar environment that's very different than the desktop. In all cases, you'll be using the same interface.
There are many ways to learn to create slides. You could watch me, or you could look up some videos on the Internet. But the best way to learn how to use the software is to use the software. So, download the demo and play around with it.
You're going to have to learn your software. And you're going to have to learn it quickly, because if you spend too much time learning the software, you'll miss your presentation.
In Keynote, the first thing you're going to do is add text. You can type directly into the presentation. There are two ways to add text. You can type text that's formatted. Or you can type unformatted text. Unformatted text can be modified after you've typed it. Formatted text can't. You have to format it before you type it.
There are many formatting options. One of them is alignment. In PowerPoint, alignment is very important, and if you're new to presenting, you will probably waste a lot of time trying to get your text to look the same on all slides. It won't work, because PowerPoint has no concept of what a slide is. PowerPoint has no idea if you're going to project a slide onto a wall, on a TV, or on a whiteboard. Keynote's different. Keynote has the concept of what a slide is. So, you can choose the alignment you like.
Alignment isn't the only option you'll want to use. You can also use headers and footers, and styles, and colors, and animations, and fonts, and text boxes, and format text, and import pictures, and insert tables, and do all kinds of other cool stuff. But you won't need to do all that. The important part of the presentation is your content, not the way it looks.
Before you begin, I have one final suggestion. Don't be nervous. It's perfectly fine to be nervous. But if you're nervous, that's a good thing. You're in control. The audience is not.
Your audience

On a distant planet, scientists discover a crashed ship with a strange creature inside. Have they discovered extraterrestrial life, or is something else going on?
Like Blake, I had a tough time with this one. I'm not exactly sure why, maybe it's because I've been getting a little jaded with horror recently, but this is one that will definitely stick with me for a while, and I'm itching to read the sequel.
It's a pretty straight forward story. We're introduced to a scientist who receives a distress call from a far away planet, the standard oaky evil English voice is telling them "Help us" then it's cut off. The signal, and the planet itself, are very sketchy to say the least, and there are no obvious signs of life.
The scientists decide to send a survey team and this is where things start to get interesting. There's a little bit of everything in here, maybe not quite enough, but definitely plenty to keep it interesting. I'm thinking two pages out of six were being taken up with a very detailed description of their spacesuits, and with good reason. Those spacesuits were quite a thing to behold, and came into play quite a bit later on.
But what was really interesting for me, and possibly the only downside, was the description of the ship. There's no actual name given, and I'm sure there's a lot of backstory with regards to this ship and the people who live on that planet, but Blake would have you know that all you need to know about this ship is that it's big, really really big. We get so much description of it, I kind of lost interest a few pages in. Now I can appreciate the importance of a huge space ship in the story, and that's a big part of what makes this a horror story, but at the same time I think that what we're given is enough.
So a little slow to start, but when we hit the action and drama, it's pretty heavy. Plenty of suspense and tension, and good humour to bring it all back down to earth, or out to the stars. Really enjoyed this one.

Wandering through the old city, one finds that even when no one is watching, the stones make a surprising amount of noise. In any given moment, there is almost always some melodious tune that can be played on the rooftops, on the abandoned ruins, along the deserted streets.
While at first the tune may sound rather forlorn and mournful, it will eventually resolve itself into the most beautiful of harmonies. In the end, everything will be just fine.

The story involves the invocation of a water sprite by a little boy. This event takes place in a typical village square, one where children play, adults greet each other, and cars drive by. Some passers-by are children and some are adults, but the age of the reader is no barrier to him or her understanding and appreciating the story.
This new installment in the 2016 iLex Award competition sets out to promote new ways of interpreting reality, which have the potential to become part of people’s everyday lives.
The book presents the adventures of Andy, a small uncorked bottle of wine, and his battle against the glass bong as he travels the roads of the world in a series of surreal adventures.
The world we see is that of adults, but in our book everything is interpreted from a different point of view, through the eyes of a child.

Amid the chaos of the storm, a local politician lashes out against a national government party, setting off a race to claim victory.
“I know some people who support Mike for mayor, and they don’t like to see him get pushed around by Steve Donnelly or anybody else, and they’re not shy about saying it,” she said.
And Loeb believes it’s working. She said members of the party are fired up to see their candidate win and will do what it takes to get him elected.
“I’ve never seen the enthusiasm that I’m seeing right now,” she said. “If anything, what Mike’s got to figure out is how he’s going to keep up with it all.”
Loeb said the GOP is winning the battle for Facebook. The pages of local candidates are filled with comments from supporters, and Loeb said in her own experience, “you can’t win a fight on Facebook.”
The Donnelly camp disagrees. They say Loeb’s race is much different than the Donnelly/McPherson competition, and it’s not about party support.
“It’s not about money,” said Jude Loftus, a campaign manager with Donnelly’s group. “It’s not about who people are giving money to. It’s about the fact that Mike Loeb is the most divisive, polarizing, ideological candidate that’s ever run for any office in Cocoa. If that’s what you want in a representative, then he’s probably your guy.”
In the end, neither side will say how much money has been raised or who’s raised the most. Both campaigns, though, say the money race won’t determine who wins the election.
“The battle lines have been drawn, and this race is going to be decided by the voters of Cocoa, and not by anybody else,” Loeb said.

The decision to embark on a solo travel adventure leads to life-changing experiences in every aspect of a person’s life. There’s nothing quite like stepping out of your comfort zone and getting on the road solo for the first time.
For people who have been traveling solo for a while now, the challenges and struggles they face are almost always overshadowed by the incredible life lessons they acquire during the journey. Solo travel helps individuals grow to become more independent, allows them to get to know themselves better, and ultimately helps them become more self-confident.
When you travel solo, there’s no one else to rely on. You have to plan for yourself and make choices. This is an invaluable experience for all travelers as it helps them become more organized and efficient. Solo travelers also gain a heightened sense of independence, as they are not reliant on anyone else to make their travel plans.
However, getting to know yourself is perhaps the most important takeaway from a solo travel adventure. You learn how to handle your emotions, which circumstances you can get through and which ones you cannot. Traveling by yourself exposes you to a wide range of emotions, such as loneliness, excitement, joy, fear, and many more.
Ultimately, you’ll find yourself becoming more self-confident and more equipped to handle unfamiliar and challenging situations. Solo travel is one of the best things you can do to enhance your self-confidence.
Get a taste of how I turned 10,000 words into one of the most expensive self-confidence-building lessons of my life here.
So, if you’re looking for the ultimate life-changing experience, you need to be traveling solo! So get on the road, discover yourself, and learn to trust in yourself as you take on life.

I'm glad I finished this graphic novel. The characters were very endearing and this is a great way to end a series, with a happy ending that was unexpected.
A good addition to the series. I like the twist at the end.
I really enjoyed this story. Dream Jumper is a good way to end the series, a wrap up as the mayor's life keeps getting better and the dream jumper is still around and doesn't have to hide anymore. Very good
I enjoyed this last book in the series. It was a good ending.
These books are a hoot, with the dream-jumper who unknowingly sets out to make people's dreams come true. This time, his most recent dream might just involve himself.

Brian K. Vaughan's YA novels are some of the best out there, I think. I read the first two when I was a kid (both signed copies, so I'm really excited for the third), but only ever got around to reading Paper Girls. Dream Jumper was a really fun and quick read. A nice little novel about friendship and hope. I also like that it is not dumbed down, though the books are still accessible to kids (at least middle schoolers).

During the world's quietest concert, the audience realizes the music is not heard, but felt through vibrations on the body. The performance of Josef Klemm. The audience realizes the music is not heard, but felt through vibrations on the body. This performance is presented by the German Embassy at 18th October at ArtisTree. The audience can experience how music influences their senses. They listen to silence.

The gentle hum of the city at dawn brought with it the pungent scent of smoke drifting on the gentle breeze, which was unusual for a July morning. Our bell boy was at the door in the morning, taking our bags to the room where we were staying. I reached for my phone, but didn’t want to wake him, so I ignored the sleepy face on the screen, turning it back over.
The crowd at the Taj Mahal that morning was thick, and the walk to the entrance of the monument was long. The temperature had already soared to a hundred degrees, and I was hot, hot and disgustingly sweaty, before the walk was even completed. The reason for the heat was easy to see. The hot, dry air off the arid deserts was rising and heading toward the cooler air of the Himalayas, and the slight breeze was a warm breath, a caress of the dust and sand that was making the morning walk and wait at the Taj a combination of discomfort and torment.
So the prospect of baking eggs was not at all appealing. However, I wasn’t particularly hungry, anyway, and was surprised at how easily I could go without the tasty breakfast that we had planned. Besides, it was too damn hot to walk around with breakfast in my stomach.
After a quick visit to the shops on the lower level of the hotel, we headed down to the dining area in the basement. The air was cool, and the buffet of Chinese and Indian dishes had all the food I was used to. The only thing that was missing was baked eggs. I started with the vegetables and fruits, moving on to more heavy and hearty fare as I made my way through the options. My sister had a potato pattie, and I followed her lead, and we started our lunches with that. We chatted about our plans for the day, and discussed what we wanted to see. I picked out a few pictures on my phone to remind myself of my goals, and we agreed to meet at the concierge desk in the hotel at noon, and set out together.
“I’m ready to go,” I said.
My sister picked up the trays and headed for the elevators. We were on the second floor and quickly on our way to the main floor. When we got to the first, I couldn’t help but notice the sweaty couple that was in the elevator with us. She wore a short, sleeveless shirt and shorts, and the sun was beating down on her fair skin. He wore a t-shirt and jeans, and was sweltering in the heat. They both had sunburns, which I knew would make the pain of their journey worse. I noticed they had no food, and realized they were probably from California.
We were heading for the front of the hotel, and our concierge was waiting for us. His nametag identified him as Krishna, and he asked how his English was. “I’m not good,” he said. I spoke for my sister and me, and said that we understood only Hindi, and were visiting from America. He was very helpful, and showed us to a tuk-tuk that was available to drive us to the Fatehpur Sikri tourist spot.
The drive was easy, and the tuk-tuk was a very cheap way to get from place to place, as we learned during the trip. We arrived at the Sikri and paid the fee, then headed inside to the palace. The building is a gigantic structure, and we had to cover more than a mile before reaching the palace. My sister and I went inside and around the building, and even went up to the top of one of the towers. When we left, we found our tuk-tuk driver and headed to our next destination.
We’d planned on visiting a different palace that day, but as we got back into the car, we were surrounded by a group of about ten boys from a local college. They begged for money, and asked if we were religious people. “Islam,” said the boys, “Islam is best.” They spoke in broken English, and my sister and I realized that they were members of the local community. They didn’t press us for money, but we knew that they were poor, and were in great need of assistance. We didn’t give them anything, and our tuk-tuk driver took us the rest of the way.
When we got to our next destination, I saw a long line at the door, and when I asked our driver what it was, he replied that it was to see the Taj Mahal. It was early, and the traffic was relatively light, so we were able to arrive at the Taj by nine o’clock. It was well worth the long trip, and I was so glad to be there. It was a sunny morning, and the water was calm. As I walked toward the entryway to the monument, I could see a great number of people lined up on the long sidewalk. The path to the entrance was clear, and so was the lawn. The trees were green, and the sun was shining through the branches, creating a light, warm feeling.
We entered the building and paid the fee, and the tickets were handed to us, each with a number. The place was quiet, with people reading, and the occasional conversation between friends. Our number was 38, and we entered the room where the ticket machines were. I took a seat next to the man in front of me, who was resting with a book in his lap. He had a pair of sunglasses perched on the top of his head, and he was smiling at me as I looked at the number on his ticket.
“How’s it going, sir?” he said.
“Good,” I said, “but it’s not the ticket that matters, it’s the experience.”
“That’s true,” he said. “How’s it going?”
“It’s fine, and I’m glad to be here.”
“You look like a rich man, and this is one of the best places to spend money.”
“I don’t know about that, but I appreciate your support. I have to go, though, I have to meet my wife and daughter in the park.”
I got up, leaving my ticket and my place on the bench, and headed for the door. The sun was high and hot, and I knew it was going to be a long walk to the gardens where we would meet. I thought about grabbing an iced tea, and considered whether it would be worth the price.
When I got to the door, I saw a line of men with feather dusters, waiting for us. I thought to myself that it was a wonderful way to get to know people, and I’m glad that I was able to experience that part of India. I was happy to be there, and happy to be a part of the experience.

When we got to the airport, we had a few hours to spare. It was mid-afternoon, and we were on our way back to the hotel to shower and rest. The airport was a hub for travel in India, and it was crowded. We looked around, but didn’t see any signs for the men’s room, and we decided to try the ladies’ room. We headed up the escalator, and I noticed a few men and women sitting at the table outside the ladies’ room. The women were dressed in saris, and the men were in casual attire.
I got in the line, and the women went to the entrance of the bathroom. I walked up to the men, and the guy who was ahead of me stepped back and pointed to the bathroom. I turned to the side, and stepped through the door. I noticed that there was a large group of women sitting at a table inside, and I figured it was a room for the ladies, not the men. I saw that the bathroom was stocked with soap, toothpaste and toothbrushes, towels and combs, and I thought to myself that it was a nice gesture on the part of the company to provide these things to their employees.
The women and men were sitting together at the table, and I noticed that the women were talking with one another in Hindi. I was surprised, and wondered what they were saying. I realized that they were probably talking about some family matter, or maybe a problem with the boss. I thought to myself that they were probably glad to have a break from their job, and I hoped that they were enjoying their time together.
As we walked through the hallway, I noticed that there was a sign that said, “Food for the worker.” I thought to myself that this was a great gesture, and I hoped that the people who worked there would be grateful for it. I also noticed that there were signs for the women’s restroom, and I was happy that I was able to find it.
When we got to the ladies’ room, I found that it was very nice. The floors were clean, and there were chairs at the tables where the women were sitting. There were

The innovative technology of the future could help boost wool production in Scotland, according to newly published research.
University of Stirling researchers are behind the new multi-year project, which aims to increase the use of wool in textiles while helping to increase domestic production of wool.
Funded by a £500,000 collaboration between Borders textile business Tensator and charity the Scottish Wool Centre, the project will see Tensator and the Scottish Wool Centre work with Stirling’s Institute for Sustainability to develop innovative wool technology.
Professor Reenat Taghaboni-Dutta, of the Stirling’s Institute for Sustainability, said: “This project, which sees the University of Stirling and Tensator working together, is a great example of how we can maximise and make the most of the amazing resources available in Scotland, such as wool.
The research aims to improve the use of sustainable raw materials such as wool and assist with tackling both the poor condition of sheep in Scotland and the ongoing decline in the quantity of wool in Scotland.
Iain Brown, Managing Director of Tensator, said: “We are delighted to be working with The Scottish Wool Centre and the University of Stirling to develop new innovative technology to ensure the wool used in Tensator’s products is sourced from Scotland.

A mysterious artifact uncovered in Egypt revealed a giant cockroach species that was thriving there 440 million years ago.
The newly-discovered animal belonged to a genus called Anax imperator. It was a 2.8-inch long creepy-crawly with a cockroach body and antennae, and most likely laid its eggs in muddy wet places. This species was found in Germany and Italy and is thought to be related to the cockroaches of today.
Anax imperator is believed to be an ancestor of the cockroaches that still inhabit Earth to this day, but it looks quite different from the ones found in your house.
Anax imperator is believed to be an ancestor of the cockroaches that still inhabit Earth to this day, but it looks quite different from the ones found in your house. The modern-day cockroach has long legs and a flattened body, with long antennae and small black eyes. But the prehistoric cockroach looks more like a ladybug, with a small head and round black eyes.
The remains of the creature, found in the Northern Red Sea in Egypt, are 38 million years older than the oldest known cockroach fossil discovered in Asia. It was first found in 2009, but it wasn’t until 2013 that scientists could determine what it was, and it wasn’t until 2015 that the discovery was published in the scientific journal Science.
Now, more than 10 years after its discovery, the fossil has been found in the Northern Red Sea, in the same region as the Mediterranean Sea, indicating that cockroaches could have lived in the Mediterranean for more than 440 million years.
The fossil was found by a team of researchers led by University of Florida geologists, who were studying the area for the fossil of a giant prehistoric land tortoise called Pentaceratops. But they kept finding small pieces of fossilized insects on top of the mudstone, so they kept digging.
At the time, scientists thought the remains belonged to a crustacean. However, they have since determined that the fossil is from a member of the cockroach family, dubbed Anax imperator.
The find shows that the oldest-known cockroach species lived in the Red Sea at least 440 million years ago, while many modern cockroaches still inhabit Earth.
It’s possible that the cockroaches lived on the surface of the ocean, though it’s not yet clear if they could have survived the harsh conditions of the ocean.
The scientists also discovered a fossil of an insect that looks like a moth. The scientists believe the moth was a cockroach.
Anax imperator, the oldest known cockroach species, lived during the Mesozoic era, when Earth was covered by a single land mass known as Pangaea.
The newly-discovered creature, the oldest known member of the cockroach family, is believed to be related to the cockroaches of today.
The researchers were looking for fossils of a prehistoric turtle called Pentaceratops, which lived on the Earth’s surface for millions of years before going extinct. Instead, they found the cockroach-like fossil among the rocks and sediment.
The researchers said they found the fossil in an area known as “Lakeside Canyon,” near the North Sea. The area is about 550 miles (890 kilometers) south of Berlin.
Cockroaches have been on Earth for more than 400 million years. They were first spotted in the fossil record in the mid-Cretaceous period, which was about 145 million years ago.
The scientists also found that the fossil is 50 million years older than the oldest known cockroach fossil from Asia. It is also about 20 million years older than the earliest fossils from the Red Sea.
It’s not clear why cockroaches were able to survive for so long in such a harsh environment.
The scientists believe that the creature, which is believed to be related to the cockroaches of today, is a member of the cockroach family.
“These findings are important because they show that Anax imperator lived during a time when there were more species of cockroaches on Earth, and when cockroaches were more diverse,” said lead author and co-author Dr. John Schuster. “This shows that the ancient cockroaches were an important part of the ecosystem.

What to watch for at the Charleston Invitational

Under the starlit sky, the campers gathered around the huge campfire. “Let’s say a group prayer and start the day off right,” said Mr. Xander. In groups, the campers prayed together.
It was a beautiful day, but first things first. No one could jump into the lake before breakfast.
Soon it was time to go to the gym to practice some of the sports skills that they were learning.
At a designated time, the campers returned to the dining hall for breakfast.
After breakfast, the campers were assigned to various activities to learn new skills.
The first activity was for all campers from the Levels 1 to 2. They learned swimming and first aid skills.
Later, the campers learned to canoe. At the end of the day, all the campers gathered around the campfire to share their experiences.
Without leaving the camp, campers went to the places they wanted to visit.
Campers returned to their dormitories at the end of the day to rest before going to bed. The activities began again early the next morning.
The last day of camp ended with the campers reviewing the things they had learned during their time at camp.
Then, in small groups, the campers shared their experiences, feelings, and emotions. The counselors then conducted a group reflection session to discuss the meaning of the camp activities.
At the end of the camp, the campers were happy, and the counselors received valuable feedback on how to improve their programs in the future.

The artist's brush danced across the canvas, creating the ghost of a man with the quick, meticulous strokes that only the experienced can master.
Tearing his brush out of the painting, the man stepped back, his eyes scanning the image to see if he liked it. Then he turned to look at his wife.
'What do you think?' he asked.
She shrugged, leaning forward to examine the painting closer.
'It's all right,' she said. 'I think it's a little bland, though.'
He sighed, and slumped back against the wall. He turned the work over so his wife could look at the back.
'You know that's the only canvas left, don't you?' he asked. 'I've finished the other eight.'
'I know,' she said. 'I'm sorry, darling, but I think it's a bit...' She searched for the right word.
'Wan?' he offered.
She nodded, and gave a small smile. He held his tongue for a second, then a smile spread across his face as he patted her behind.
'Looks like you win this round, my love,' he said, laughing.
He turned back to his painting, and started over. He worked the brush as if he was making love to it, and as he got lost in the motion of painting, he forgot all about his wife's criticism.
Twenty years passed, and the man was no longer as young as he used to be. He grew tired as the years passed, but he was a man of his word, and so he painted every day. Every day he painted until the light from the window dimmed to night. Every day he painted until his wife's kissed his brow.
One day he came home to find his wife crying. She was holding his daughter's head in her lap. His daughter was covered in blood, and her eyes stared lifelessly at the ceiling.
'It was an accident,' the wife told him, her face contorted in grief. 'Your wife, she must have been feeling unwell, she must have accidentally...'
The man nodded. He knew it was his wife who did it. His wife, who had grown tired of her husband, and had grown tired of his constant work on the paintings.
His wife who thought he had gone senile, as he spent hours on end painting over the paintings, erasing the other images to make it fresh again.
His wife, who decided that the child was the competition, and so had decided to take action.
The man picked up a brush, and pushed his wife's hand away from the child's neck.
'You've had your chance,' he told her, as he painted the face of the child into the painting. 'Now it's mine.'
'My husband, please!' she cried. 'The baby's still alive, for God's sake! The blood, the wound...'
The man glanced at the wife's hand, then at the child's throat. The little girl was still breathing, the throat was still bleeding, but the man did not care.
'You wanted to compete, didn't you?' he said, reaching up to grab a brush. 'Well, that's what you're going to do. You're going to compete with me. You're going to compete, and if you don't win, then you'll lose.'
He turned away, to continue the painting, and he could hear his wife's sobs growing louder. But that was all right. If she wanted to cry, then he'd paint louder, and harder, and faster, and he would win.
Even though he did not know what the painting would be. He only knew that it was there, and that he would be the one to paint it.
The next day, the wife sat on her husband's lap as he continued painting. She was quieter, although she still trembled with sadness. But she did not cry, she merely clutched the brush in his hand as if it was her own.
The man painted, and he painted, and he painted, until the sun set over the horizon. Then he stood back to examine the painting, and his wife's eyes followed his.
The man had managed to paint a strange, horrific face, a twisted figure with a gaping mouth and bulging, black eyes.
His wife could not speak. She could only shake her head, over and over, as her husband smiled.
'What do you think, my love?' the man asked. 'Did I win this round?'
The wife struggled with her words, but she managed to give a soft, 'yes.'
The man grinned.
'Then come over here,' he said. 'Put your hand on this painting, right here, like this.'
The wife hesitated, but she followed his instructions, and her hand touched the painting. Her hand glowed, and a strange screaming sound came from the painting. Then, in a great gout of smoke, the painting was gone.
The wife shrieked.
'Now it's your turn, my love,' the man said, still smiling. 'Put your hand on the canvas.'
His wife shook her head.
'I...' she said. 'I don't want to do it.'
'Of course you do,' the man said. 'Of course you do.'
The man was about to say something else when the painting spoke to him, calling him by his name.
'Yes, what is it?' the man said. 'What do you want?'
The painting showed him its teeth.
'I want to eat, my love,' it said.
The wife pushed the man aside and backed away.
'I can't do this,' she said, her voice trembling. 'I can't do this.'
'Don't you want to win?' the man asked.
'What do you think? I want to win,' the wife said. 'But not like that! Not by losing! I'll do it, but...'
She gestured at the painting.
'Just give me one minute to say goodbye to my daughter.'
The man nodded, and moved away to give her some privacy. He smiled at his wife's love, but he knew she would not win. She was too scared, too unprepared, and too good at losing.
The wife closed her eyes.
'I love you,' she said.
Then she slumped to the ground.
'I love you,' she said again, softly.
The man started to turn around, then he caught sight of the painting, staring back at him, its open mouth a gaping maw.
'Wait!' he shouted, rushing back to the painting. He dropped to his knees, and reached out to the painting.
'Please,' he said. 'Please, give her one more minute.'
The painting shook its head.
'I...' the man began. 'I'm not afraid of you.'
The painting's mouth opened wider.
'But...' the man said, turning to look at the corpse of his wife, and the blood that stained the floor.
'I need to win,' he whispered, as he dipped his fingers into the paint.
The man painted the lips of the figure, and he painted until his fingers ached. Then he stood, and watched the last of the paint dry.
'Goodbye, my love,' he said, as he walked towards the painting.
The figure did not move, and did not speak, but it smiled.
The wife's eyes were open as she lay next to the body of her daughter. She was smiling too, her hands folded together on her chest.
'I love you, my love,' the man said, his eyes searching for the painting.
He was smiling, and his teeth were white.
It took me a little longer than usual to finish this one. A couple of scenes I just didn't know how to write. But I think they'll come to me when I look at the picture again, in the future.
But at least I got the painting finished! I'm quite pleased with it.

At dawn, the mountains cast shadows that fall into a meadow. Lying in the wet grass is a puppy.
And, in the meadow is a human shadow... of a man, a boy.
The human shadow is the shadow of a heart, and that's where I want to be.
How do I find you? What can I do to create a different reality?
Will you choose to be held?
Will you believe in me?
Will you forgive me for not knowing how to help you?
I'm not sure how to change the hurt.
But I'm here, I'm alive and real.

Within the walls of the castle, hidden passages, cellars and dungeons lie. A quarter of the building, called the underground, is underground. 50 steps through tunnels, stairs, ladders and slopes lead through to the inner courtyard. Another 50 steps lead down to the castle cistern, which is a mirror image of the underground. The bottom level of the underground is 6 meters below ground level.
As you descend into the underground, you will find the Castle Café, the Dunkle Kemenate, a bar and a toilet. From there it gets dark and musty. From time to time, there is a guided tour through the underground and the cistern.
Walter von Haldenwang in 1303 built the first castle on the site. The castle was expanded, modified, extended and rebuilt many times. In the 19th century, the family of Karl Theodor, the Prince of Bavaria-Oberpfalz, bought the castle from the castle. Soon it became a prison.
In 1874, the premises were reorganized and extended for a second time. The kitchen was no longer used, the cistern was filled up and a new drainage system was created.
On 26 July 1914, the Electoral Prince Rupprecht von Bayern, the brother of the last king Ludwig III. was exiled and arrested in the castle. He spent his confinement in one of the rooms of the underground.
In 1918, the castle became the property of the Bavarian State. During the Third Reich, it was part of the castle’s collections, and for the people of Nuremberg it became a treasure trove of toys. In 1945, the castle was looted. In the 1960s, it was renovated and rebuilt several times.
In 1962, the so-called “Tasting hall” in the south-east wing was renovated. Between 1994 and 1995, a cultural building was built to the north of the courtyard. In 1998, a rebuilding and renovation of the Castle took place. The castle was renovated for three and a half years. From 2006 to 2011, the renovation of the castle’s living quarters took place. Between 2005 and 2006, the conversion of the state rooms and halls into a permanent exhibition area took place. In 2016, the castle’s cistern and the underground were renovated.
In the underground, they built a visitor centre, an exhibition hall, a museum shop, an educational room and a restaurant. On the ground floor there are also some permanent exhibitions.
There is a small café and restaurant inside the castle. Admission costs are €5, and it’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Nuremberg Old Town and Harbour – A visit to the Maritimes Museum

Underneath the moonlit sky, the path leads to the grand beach house. The towering waves of Lake Michigan splash in front of the lakeside mansion. Each piece of porcelain on the dinner table has a story to tell. The guests, in their full glory, walk over to the brightly lit table and sit. The voices of every guest have an air of curiosity with a deep meaning behind it. The 800-square-foot candlelit table is filled with waiters, each one with a plate of food.
“I was born in this country. I got my citizenship. I have my rights. And you just make life miserable because you don’t want to see a dark face,” Manu, a waiter said.
Manu, a 50-year-old Guatemalan immigrant, has been working at the Glen Arbor Golf Resort, located in Glen Arbor, Michigan, since 2005.
He has lived in America for 27 years, waiting for his son to get a green card, come back home and graduate with a degree.
Manu has had it with America.
There are many more dark-skinned men like Manu who have faced racial slurs, discrimination and hate crimes. According to the Association of Asian American Studies, hate crimes have increased by 17 percent in the past decade.
Sabu, a 48-year-old Indian immigrant who owns a dry cleaning business in West Chicago, has faced some problems like Manu’s in his life.
One day, a man came into the store and yelled, “Why don’t you go back to India where you came from?” said Sabu.
According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 50 percent of Asian Americans have experienced some form of workplace discrimination.
This negative attitude towards Asians has been a growing concern in America.
In 2008, Chinese professor Xiaolu Peng decided to compile a study on the general perception of Asians in America and their treatment by Americans.
According to his research, Asians are more likely to be seen as “economic competition,” and a threat to jobs.
Peng says that more and more Asians are treated poorly by Americans and the hostility towards Asians is becoming increasingly explicit.
“In my opinion, the relationship between Americans and Asians is characterized by a perceived competition for resources,” Peng said.
Sabu has seen firsthand how Asians have been portrayed negatively in American media, and he has a negative opinion of how America treats Asians.
According to the 2010 Census, 20.2 percent of Asians were born in the United States, while 78.6 percent were foreign-born.
While some Asians, such as Sabu and Manu, have negative perceptions of how America treats Asians, others, such as Ola, a 32-year-old Somali immigrant, have a positive outlook on how America treats Asians.
“I don’t think there is any hate. I think it’s a general perspective of where a lot of these people came from,” Ola said.
Ola, who is Muslim, moved to America 16 years ago and is happy with his life and how he is treated.
In Ola’s opinion, there is a common misconception that people have of Asians in America.
“People think because they are Asians, they all own businesses and have some sort of wealth and it’s all handed to them,” Ola said.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, 58.3 percent of Asian households were headed by foreign-born Asians, while 39.1 percent were headed by U.S.-born Asians.
Though Asians are widely stereotyped and racial issues such as “yellow face” and “fish out of water” still affect Asians in the workplace, they are treated equally in America.
In America, Asians are just another minority. Though they are not as powerful as whites, Asians are treated with respect and given equal opportunities.
Manu says, “I’m not saying that in other countries you can go work, but in America, you can.”

Henry Ford’s electric automobile
In 1889, shortly after the invention of the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, Henry Ford’s first car, a two-cylinder vehicle powered by an electric motor, was tested in Detroit. A four-hour demonstration by Ford and fellow engineers was a failure because the batteries ran out of power before the car could be driven 100 yards down the street. It was a tremendous disappointment for Ford, who had to return to his job with the Detroit Edison Company.
But Ford’s inventive nature would not be deterred. In December of that year, he announced a new car: the Ford Quadricycle. Although still powered by a gasoline engine, this vehicle was very different from its predecessor. The Quadricycle had an enclosed passenger compartment and was run on rubber tires instead of steel wheels.
Ford again faced failure when, on June 4, 1896, he was in an accident on the Detroit and Cincinnati Railroad. He had tested the Quadricycle outdoors on a railroad right-of-way and somehow collided with a railway train, smashing the rear axle.
Ford decided to build a second Quadricycle and on October 9, 1896, put it on the road for a test drive. This time he and a companion traveled the length of the track, a distance of 16 miles. In his second test Ford was more successful and announced that he had built the first gasoline-powered automobile.
The new machine allowed Ford to achieve something he had never had before–freedom. No longer was he tied to the railroads, and when he was unable to sell his automobile he walked from Detroit to Dearborn, Michigan, a distance of 25 miles. It took him three days, but he was free to travel anywhere he wished.
In 1988, more than a century after Ford first came up with the idea for the automobile, he was posthumously awarded a patent for his Quadricycle. Ford passed away in 1947, 51 years before the United States Patent Office began to issue posthumous patents.

The discovery of a lost city beneath a coffee shop, inhabited by caffeine-powered gnomes, leads to a mission for Shane and Joanne to rescue its leader.
Will there be enough power in the city to sustain a successful evacuation?
Joanne must stop the gnomes from destroying the power and inadvertently destroying themselves.
Will the gnomes live or will they perish?
“Professor Garfield, can you really fix this building?”
“It might take a few days, but yes, I can.”
“Great. I’ll get a few days’ work done in there.”
I walked over to the edge of the concrete square in which the latest evil stood. “Where exactly is the city buried?”
Shane pointed to the door at the far end of the room.
“Come on, let’s get you inside. I’ll need to get a look at the damage.”
Shane opened the door, revealing a set of stone steps that led down into the earth. “Woah,” he said.
At the bottom, the earth continued to be worked up. From where I stood it was impossible to see the bottom of the construction. I looked up, trying to gauge its height. It wasn’t high, but the amount of effort and the amount of materials used made it high enough.
“Pretty high,” Shane said.
“High enough,” I said. “We’re not using this building. There’s no point. We’ll wait until we’ve cleaned this place up and then we’ll talk about what to do next. For now, let’s get you back into the house. I’ll give you a few things to help with the stairs.”
Shane didn’t protest, he grabbed the food I gave him and followed me back up to the living room.
The new flat screen television was still on. I turned it off. I hoped there were no more demons watching TV.
Shane looked at the TV and looked at me. “Is that real?” he asked.
I nodded. I didn’t expect him to understand, but I needed to explain how Shane’s father had worked for me. I didn’t have to tell Shane about his dad’s secret life as a detective, I knew that Shane would figure it out soon enough.
“I’m sorry I was offline when I got your call. I got some news and had to disappear for a while. I’m back now. Shane, this is your grandfather.”
I found a chair and sat down. “Now that you’re here, what’s the next step? I think I know what the next step will be, but I can’t tell if you’re on the same page as me.”
“I was looking for the secret passage.”
I sighed. “What is this? Another one of these supernatural secret passage thingies?”
“This is a gnome city. I found the door when I was cleaning, but before I could tell anybody about it, a demon burst through and made off with the key.”
“You’re going to have to explain. We haven’t the time for this. What is it, Shane?”
“This is a gnome city. I found the door when I was cleaning, but before I could tell anybody about it, a demon burst through and made off with the key.” Shane’s eyes widened as he spoke. “Now it’s in that building there. Joanne, I thought I had done the one thing that would keep you safe.”
“It’s going to take a long time to get rid of the demons. Even if we destroy the building, there are many more in the area.”
“What? That’s what you do in the gnome city?”
“I have to get down there and stop it. They’ll destroy the city if they break the power supply.”
“We have to get the key back. This is the first time they’ve been out of the city.”
“If you could speak to them and stop them, that would be one thing.”
“Not speaking to demons is like not speaking to people. What am I going to say? ‘Please, demon, leave the gnome city alone. It’s not a place for you. Go back to where you came from, demon.’”
“What do you want from me? You’re the expert. You’re the one who has a degree in this sort of thing. Is there anything I can do to help?”
“Yes. I’ve been on the internet for hours and there are plenty of stories about people with magic powers.”
I stared at him, incredulous. “I’m not taking this seriously.”
“Joanne, please. You said that there are many more of these demon things in the area. I don’t know what to do.”
“This is insane, Shane.”
“I don’t know, Joanne. There are so many of them, and they have so much power, I don’t know what to do.”
“We’re in a flat. I don’t know if you noticed, but it’s a pretty boring place.”
Shane walked over to the door and opened it. He stood there, motionless, as he looked out.
“I don’t know if this is the right thing to do. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I can’t keep running away from this. I have to do something, Joanne.”
Shane closed the door and turned to me. He had tears in his eyes. He put his arms around me and kissed me on the cheek.
“Please, Joanne. I’m sorry. I’ve just had too much. It’s all been too much.”
“What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do?” Shane’s words rang in my ears. “I’m sorry. I don’t know how to do this. I’m sorry.”
“I’m sorry,” I said again.
“I don’t know what to do. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. Please, help me.”
“I don’t know how to do this.”
“I can’t. I don’t know how to do this.”
“I don’t know how to do this. I’m sorry, I can’t do this.”
“I don’t know how to do this. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
“I don’t know how to do this.”
“I can’t do this. I can’t do this.”
“I can’t do this. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
“I’m sorry, I can’t do this. I can’t.”
“I don’t know how to do this. I’m sorry, I can’t.”
“I don’t know how to do this. I can’t do this. I can’t.”
“I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. I can’t do this.

At the worst zoo in the world, the main attraction is an invisible giraffe that everyone claims to see.
To avoid being seen while on his nightly giraffe viewing, an old man follows the herd while covering his eyes with a flashlight.
While on his nightly giraffe viewing trip, the man is surprised to find a full-grown ostrich that is wearing eye shadow, makeup, and lipstick. He is even more surprised to find that the ostrich can talk.
The ostrich asks the man to tell her the truth. The man reluctantly agrees to tell her the truth.
"Whenever the news reports talk about a giraffe or a zebra, it turns out to be a darn ostrich. They don't even think about it. When they report about a darn ostrich, they say, 'There's an ostrich over there,'" the ostrich says.
"You're an ostrich."
"Yes, I'm an ostrich," the ostrich answers. "But not just an ostrich. I'm an African ostrich."
"I've seen you," the man says. "You don't have a darn African accent."
"That's because it's the Internet," the ostrich says. "It's not a real giraffe. I don't have a darn African accent because I'm on the Internet. I don't have a darn African accent.
Sometimes I like to imagine what it would be like to be an ostrich."
"Well, if you want to see a giraffe," the old man says, "don't look to the zoo. Go to the Internet. They have one on there."
The ostrich says, "Thank you."
The old man continues to follow the herd while the ostrich stands in the shadows.
One day, the old man sees the giraffe. The ostrich sees him. He is dumbfounded. He doesn't know how the giraffe got there.
"I think I should show you something," the ostrich says.
The ostrich takes out his iPhone and plays a video.
"I think I should tell you something," the ostrich says. "I have a few ideas about what this could be. The truth is, I don't know what it is."
The old man looks at the video and says, "I think I know what it is. I think it's a zebra."
"Well, then," the ostrich says. "You're in luck. It's a zebra."
The old man is stunned. He has never seen a zebra before.
"Do you know how to tell the difference between a zebra and an ostrich?" the ostrich asks.
"Well," the old man replies. "I can see a difference in their eyes."
"It's not their eyes. It's their feathers."
"But what does that mean? Are you saying that I'm looking at a zebra that's not an ostrich?"
"Yes," the ostrich says. "You're looking at an ostrich that is a zebra. It's a zebra with feathers."
"Well," the old man says, "how can a zebra with feathers be a giraffe?"
"Well, you know, I don't know," the ostrich says. "I have no idea. I just know that I've been seeing zebras. I've seen a lot of them. And this one is the best zebra I've ever seen. It's a real zebra. It's so real that it looks like a zebra. I don't know what it is. It just looks like a zebra.
It looks like an African ostrich."
"Well," the old man says, "let's talk about it."
"No," the old man says, "I think we should get you back on the Internet. I've seen enough of you. You're not a zebra. You're an ostrich. I've seen your eyes. You're an ostrich. I've seen your tail. You're an ostrich. I've seen your beak. You're an ostrich."
"Yes, I am an ostrich," the ostrich says.
"That's because it's the Internet," the ostrich says. "And I don't have a darn African accent because I'm on the Internet. I don't have a darn African accent.
And sometimes I like to imagine what it would be like to be a zebra."
The old man laughs. He walks over to the giraffe and says, "I don't know what you are. You're a zebra."
The ostrich looks at the giraffe and says, "That's what I thought."
The old man laughs again. "Oh, my gosh. You're right. You're a zebra. You're a real zebra.
How are you a zebra?
The ostrich shrugs. "I don't know," he says. "It's the Internet."
The old man sits down on the ground and the two of them stare at the giraffe for a moment.
"Oh, my gosh," the old man says. "This is amazing. I think I should show you something."
The old man takes out his iPhone and plays the video.
"I think I should tell you something," the ostrich says. "I have a few ideas about what this could be. The truth is, I don't know what it is.
"But what does that mean? Are you saying that I'm looking at a zebra that's not an ostrich?"
"I don't know," the old man says. "I don't know. But it's real. It's real. It's real."
The ostrich laughs. "Well, then," the ostrich says. "It's real."
The ostrich walks over to the giraffe and looks at it. "It's real," he says.
"Well," the old man says, "you've got me there. I guess it is real. And if it's real, then you're a zebra. And that means you're an African ostrich."
The old man takes out his iPhone and plays another video. "I think I should tell you something," the ostrich says. "I have a few ideas about what this could be. The truth is, I don't know what it is.
"Well," the old man says. "It's a zebra. It's a zebra."
"Well, you know, I don't know," the ostrich says. "I have no idea. I just know that I've been seeing zebras. I've seen a lot of them. And this one is the best zebra I've ever seen. It's a real zebra. It's so real that it looks like a zebra. I don't know what it is. It just looks like a zebra.

You're not a zebra. You're an ostrich. I've seen your eyes. You're an ostrich. I've seen your tail. You're an ostrich. I've seen your beak. You're an ostrich. That's because it's the Internet. And I don't have a darn African accent because I'm on the Internet. I don't have a darn African accent.

The mysterious stranger in town had a story that sounded almost too good to be true. It may have been the obvious possibility that the other stranger was the Devil in disguise or a ruse, but something compelled her to believe him.
In this weird, short story based on a plot by Edgar Allan Poe, the supernatural looms over the reader who may choose to believe or disbelieve, but by the end of the tale, they are left with a tingling sensation of unease.
This short story is set in the fictional Southern town of Baskerville, where a young woman lives alone after losing both her father and her fiancé within a year. But she’s not alone for long as the mysterious stranger enters her life and entices her with a story about his father who had fallen in love with a woman who was “not of his caste”—which in this case means he was a notorious outlaw.
The young woman, believing him, takes him into her home in hopes of marrying him, but the question then arises, are they telling the truth or is the stranger really the devil in disguise?
The reader follows along as the couple interacts with each other, reveals pieces of their pasts, and shares their struggles and fears of the unknown. When the truth comes out, the young woman is left wondering if she has truly lost her soul or not.
This short story was written by Susan Stephens, and its target age range is for ages 10 and older.
There were so many things that drew me into this story. I couldn’t put it down.
The first was the intriguing mystery surrounding the mysterious stranger, which from the very beginning has an unearthly feeling.
The second was the amazing twist in the storyline at the end, which I didn’t see coming.
Third was the spooky atmosphere the writer created with her words. I felt like I was there with the characters and could see them—and the world—as they did.
If you want a great, quick read that is spooky yet beautiful, try this one out. I think you’ll like it.
Overall, I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars.

At an underground market for enchanted items, a bargain on a magic carpet leads to an unexpected journey to a long-lost land. I hope you enjoy and find this a compelling read. Thanks for reading!
An Ancient Breeze Came
Blowing like a storm.
The carpet felt warmth.
Wake up and run.
A hot breeze rose from beneath the surface of the desert, soft and rumbling. This was an anomaly—the desert was supposed to be cool, not hot. Javon scrambled to his feet, the sands shifting beneath his feet. “We should go,” he said, pulling on his clothes. He watched for footprints that would lead to their means of escape. Finding none, he grabbed a vial of water from his pack and used it to wet his face. “The beast,” he said, looking at the carpet. “It’s trying to help us.”
The carpet rose as Javon spoke, its woven fibers straining as it pushed upward, reluctant to leave its shelter.
“All we can do now is hurry,” Javon said. He spun on his heels and began to sprint across the dunes. He looked back at the ground for tracks, but they had been erased.
He ran for only a minute before feeling the effects of the heat. His heart pounded and his chest constricted. Sweat dripped from his brow and he knew the carpet could take only a little more of this. He sped up, but it wouldn’t be enough. He didn’t know what they would do when they reached the mountain.
Javon looked over his shoulder. The carpet trailed them, only a few hundred yards away. As they reached the edge of the desert, a faint tingling sensation danced across his skin. He knew the carpet was using magic to lead them in the right direction. His heart pounded in his chest.
When they reached the mountain, Javon lay on the sand to catch his breath, the vial clutched in his sweaty hands. He wished that he had at least a single bottle of water. His sweat had turned into a salty residue that stung his eyes. The night had passed in a blur of fear and panic. “The carpet,” he said.
His companion glanced back. “It is…it is.” She climbed up onto the carpet and sat. She adjusted her clothing and cooled her flushed face.
Javon could barely make out her features in the moonlight. “I want to tell you that I’m sorry about what happened. It won’t happen again.”
She reached out and took his hand. “I know,” she said. “I want to be able to trust you, Javon.”
He grinned. “Then, maybe we should just run.”
She giggled. “Oh, no! I’m taking you prisoner and keeping you close to me for a while.”
“Do you like me?” he said, looking into her dark eyes.
“What if I don’t?”
“You will,” he said, pulling her close. He kissed her on the lips.
She kissed him back. “I like you very much,” she said, finally pulling away.
The tingling sensation returned and Javon realized that they were back on the sand. His clothes were dry and cool. A chilly breeze felt like heaven after the furnace they had just left. “How long have we been out?”
“Seems like only a few minutes,” he said, sitting down beside her.
“Good, because I’m very hungry.” She laughed.
He pulled her against him. “I like that.”
They sat in the moonlight, each wrapped up in their own thoughts. The carpet rose and began to carry them forward, past the caves and the occasional bones of caravans that had been caught in a sandstorm. He placed his hand on hers and she squeezed back, holding on for dear life. Javon had never been so happy before in his life. He fell asleep before she did.
The morning sun broke the horizon, illuminating the landscape. Javon felt stiff and sore, but he didn’t mind. They found a spring that ran through the mountain and drank their fill. He spied a cave and climbed inside, shepherding her before him.
“I think we should make it our base,” he said, turning back to her.
“What? Here?” she said.
He shrugged. “It’s better than being trapped in the dunes. We won’t have any more monsters to worry about.” He walked to the mouth of the cave, scanning the horizon for threats. He couldn’t tell if he heard distant footsteps or if he was still dreaming. “Do you trust me?” he said, his voice echoing within the cave.
She smiled, stepping closer. “I always do.”
He leaned in, kissing her once more.
She smiled, blushing. “Of course. Are you ready to see what we’ve found?”
He gestured for her to lead the way.
Javon helped her into the cave and she looked around. “We’re going to have a feast,” she said.
“Of course, let’s go.”
She led him to a dry stream bed and began filling a sack with water. “It’s the least we can do for him.”
Javon followed behind her. “Aren’t you afraid? We don’t know what this thing is.”
She tossed her hair back, her features glowing in the light. “It’s a carpet and it’s saved our lives twice now.” She paused. “So, I think we can trust it.”
He grinned. “Okay, but I still want to know what it is.”
She shrugged. “I guess we’ll find out soon enough.” She turned around. “Do you want to see what we’ve found?”
He couldn’t hide his delight. “I’m ready.”
She smiled, reaching out and pulling him into a kiss. He tasted the desert sand on her lips and it was like nothing he had ever felt before. She squeezed his arm and he suddenly found himself in her arms, stumbling backwards and onto the ground. She lay on top of him, and he was shocked at her boldness. He reached up and touched her, realizing that her skin was warm to the touch. He saw how her dark eyes gazed at him and he felt as if he was going to pass out.
“Well?” she said, as he turned his gaze away from her and out into the daylight.
He looked down at her. “Well what?”
“Do you like it?” she said, reaching into the sack she had been filling.
He realized that he was still on the ground, and her fingers were stained with the dirt. He pushed himself up into a sitting position. He felt as if his heart would burst from his chest. “What is it?”
She smiled, holding it out. “My favorite food!”
Javon looked at her fingers, still stained from the dirt. “You’re a terrible cook.” He reached out and took it from her. “Give me the sack. I’ll get it clean.”
She smirked. “Is that a compliment?”
“I said I like you. I like you very much.”
She giggled. “And I like you, too. Let’s eat.” She rose from the ground and stretched. She turned back to him, walking in a circle. “It was very nice…” she began.
“Don’t say it.” He walked out of the cave, holding the carpet in front of him. He turned back. “Don’t even try it.”
She laughed. “Oh, I don’t need to try anything. You were in my arms just a moment ago.”
He nodded. “Yes, and now we’re not, so just stop.”
“You need to eat,” she said.
“No, you need to.”
She stomped her foot. “Fine.” She walked out into the sunlight, giving him a scowl. He turned and followed, dropping the carpet on the ground. “You’re making me starve, you know.”
He reached down and held the carpet in front of him. “It’s cool out here.” He walked back into the cave and tossed the carpet onto the floor. He moved back and forth in front of the entrance, looking out. “What are you doing?”
“I don’t know,” she said, staring at the ground. “I’m getting so hot.”
Javon walked over to her, kneeling down in front of her. He put his hands on her shoulders and gently pressed her back. “Do you like it?”
“Like what?” she said, squirming beneath his touch.
“The desert heat.”
She shrugged. “I like it, but I think I need some water.”


When pets gain the ability to speak for 24 hours, a family's lazy cat reveals that she was murdered. With the help of detective Oscar (Robert De Niro), the family must catch the murderer in their household.
I'm guessing this movie came out in the 1960s or earlier. The funny thing is, I found it while searching on Netflix for the newer Evan Almighty, which also had a horrible title. This version is better.
I've seen this movie before, but it was a long time ago. It's about a detective named Oscar (played by Robert De Niro) who happens upon the family when the family's lazy and selfish cat Reuben is suddenly able to speak. As they talk, Reuben tells Oscar that the family actually murdered him and then he describes how they did it.
The family is incredulous, but a murder in their house is actually proven, and the youngest daughter calls the police. They then go about trying to figure out who did it, aided by their cat who gives them clues here and there. Of course they catch the killer in the end, who is of course the brother of the family (not the mother), but I won't tell you the method or how they do it.
This is a cute movie for the family, as it has comedy and drama and it is also a movie that you can really talk about with the family afterward. I like the way the story keeps you guessing. Some will catch the murderer early on, but others might not. I am like a detective. I will find the clues before they are found.
I found this movie while I was searching for Evan Almighty (2007) and someone gave the movie an extra "e" in the title, as it should have been called Everyone Says I Love You (1996). I clicked on that one by mistake, and ended up watching this one instead.
I like the songs in this movie, especially the theme song (which is from It's a Grand Old Fashioned Christmas by Frank Sinatra). There are a number of songs in it, and you can tell that this movie is intended to be a comedy.
This is one of those movies where you know from the start who the murderer is, but you want to be surprised at the end. I really don't want to give the end away, so you'll just have to watch the movie.
This is a very entertaining movie. It's enjoyable to watch for young and old alike. It is probably the kind of movie that I will watch again.

In a world powered by laughter, a comedy show becomes the unlikely battleground for a far greater power struggle.

The lone hiker's journey across the desert tested the limits of human endurance
A new docudrama follows Ernest Kellerman’s 1938 hike through Death Valley, told entirely in his own words.
Image: PBS
The desert is an unforgiving place. Throughout history, it has been the setting of many failed expeditions, many fatalities, and almost unbearable suffering. It's a force of nature that will run over you and leave you for dead.
That's what makes the story of Ernest Kellerman so remarkable.
Ernest, a 30-year-old railroad brakeman in 1938, embarked on a long-distance journey through Death Valley, 300 miles through one of the world's most inhospitable places. His intention was to hike from the lowest point in North America to its highest—the Badwater Basin at 282 feet below sea level to the peak of Mount Whitney at 14,494 feet—in under two weeks. His remarkable physical prowess and burning determination, however, would not allow for such an easy feat.
A train, a rifle, and a dog
On March 31, 1938, Kellerman set out, carrying 28 pounds of equipment, 20 pounds of food, and a .30-06 hunting rifle. He traveled with his only companion, a tiny half-pint Australian shepherd dog named Albert.
Image: Daniel Horowitz / PBS
Kellerman writes that he didn't have the time or the energy to build a trail of his own, so he walked wherever he could. At some points he was just inches away from the edge of a canyon. Other times he found himself wading through knee-deep water. And at other points he encountered giant stone slabs that took everything he had to climb over.
In many ways, Kellerman's odyssey was just another adventure for this young American. Yet, this journey was about more than just surviving through the desert: it was also about learning about the history and land of the region he was traveling through.
Kellerman’s camera as a recorder of history
Kellerman carried with him a camera that he used to document the trail in detail. "I take the camera along," he writes, "in hopes of seeing something I have never seen before. That thought is in my mind all of the time." The product of his journey is a photo journal, showing what the Death Valley looked like in 1938. He writes:
The only way for me to see it for myself is to do it. The first thing I have to do is get out of civilization. That means I must get to a place where there are no more people, no more motors, no more cameras, no more buses, no more movie stars, no more women. But I have my photo camera to show me that man is everywhere, in every kind of a way, so I have to bring my camera along. I take the camera along, in hopes of seeing something I have never seen before. That thought is in my mind all of the time.
Kellerman's camera is the best thing I have ever seen in my life
"And on my camera the lens cap is on," Kellerman writes. "The shutter is ready to snap."
Not a single frame was printed
Of the approximately 1,600 negatives from Kellerman's trip, only one print was ever produced, the image shown here. It was made by Kellerman on a small makeshift printing table near one of the many geologic wonders that make Death Valley one of the United States' most unique destinations.
Above: Two weeks after leaving Las Vegas, Nevada, Kellerman at the foot of Dante's View in Death Valley.
The question of why there are so few photos from this journey remains unanswered. While it may not be surprising that no other prints were made at the time (the 28-page text was the main focus of the project, with no desire to put images in the story), we know that Kellerman printed dozens of photos after his journey. It's a little more puzzling as to why he didn't take any pictures from the Death Valley National Monument.
Above: Kellerman writes about trying to take a photo of the Golden Canyon. "Although I had a camera with me, I am afraid it is useless, since it does not take an exposure of that length of time."
It was 1938, and Kellerman was traveling through Death Valley—a desert that never stops moving. Photographs were not yet routine. Smartphones and digital cameras with unlimited storage were nowhere to be found. For many travelers, simply experiencing the natural world around them without a camera was something they could live with. And Kellerman was no different: "I have the thought in my mind all the time," he writes. "And I take the camera along, to get it out of my mind."

"An animation to make all that have worked with the genre proud"
- Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun-Times)

The old fisherman's tales of the sea were both captivating and horrifying to the young villagers. When bad weather, strong currents, or overfishing occurred, these seamen often reported violent activity in the ocean. Their nightmarish experiences were attributed to the spirits of former fishermen still at sea and unable to rest in peace.
To protect fishermen and their families from disaster at sea, the elders commissioned a representation of the sea's darkest spirit. The sculpture was placed in the center of the village, where it would be able to protect the village's sea-faring families.
Now, this fabled symbol protects the ships, the fishermen and their families. After centuries of inactivity, the sculpture begins to move. Its unearthly power turns the sea into a graveyard for fishing vessels.
The sculpture of the sea's darkest spirit can be found at the top of the stacks.

This is an odd story that centers around a magician who rescues a mermaid and takes her to his new laboratory. Together they do experiments to try and turn the mermaid into a human. It also features a talking chimp who is interested in experimenting with human women.

In an alternate universe where socks are the currency, a mismatched pair could be the key to unlocking an entire new way of life. Before the debut of Muppets Most Wanted, the original Muppet Gang spent the years 1981-1984 hosting a variety of television specials. In one special, entitled Sesame Street Episode 2133: The Worm Turns, four pairs of mismatched socks have fallen off the TV screen and into the parallel universe of Muppetland. Our heroes, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Rizzo the Rat, and Sam Eagle find these socks on the ground, where one of them becomes embroiled in a dispute between the rival armies of the Hogs and the Snails, who are at war over a matter of some socks.
In the Muppet universe, socks come in one of two varieties: pairs, and threesomes. The Snails, who favor threesomes, demand that Kermit return them to the threesome which also included another sock. Naturally, the Hogs, who prefer pairs, have a different story.
With three separate armies representing each of the sock factions — all in possession of their own socks — negotiations for peace become embroiled in farce and stalemate. It takes the arrival of a small band of travelling troubadours — the Talking Trash Can Troupe — to find an even way out of the situation.
At the suggestion of the Talking Trash Can Troupe, a compromise is finally reached: a truce, during which the Hogs and the Snails each take turns possessing a single pair of socks, that both may wear each sock in turn.
And then things go back to normal.

In a bizarre cooking show twist, contestants must create gourmet dishes using only ingredients from a typical office, including paperclips, staples, and the note-passing fire extinguisher.
Rating: PG-13 Genre: Reality-TV Runtime: 45 min.
It seems as if a stranger has invaded the office. Who is he? Where did he come from? What does he want? Just kidding! He’s a one-armed man dressed in a jumpsuit and using a hand puppet to communicate. The man is Jonathan Waxman, a famous chef and the first guest judge of the first episode of Top Chef Masters, and with him we start the first challenge: utilizing the contents of an office in order to create a fine-dining meal.
Contestants know that they’re competing in a competition, but they don’t know the rules. They’ll have no time to prepare for the challenge, and what they make is what they get. As the cooks do their best to whip up Michelin-rated fare from the contents of an office, we can’t help but notice that there’s no Dunder Mifflin logo on the contents list. And they have to do it all without using things that could be considered dangerous.
It’s not clear what kind of office supplies will be available, so the contestants can only guess. When they get to the set, they are stunned to find out that they’re each given a supply-station! Not only are they given a selection of odds and ends that include bread, fish, chicken, and vegetables, but they also have a supply-station that contains whatever is in an office, including office supplies. I think my favorite item was the dispenser for office cups, which contained a variety of delicacies like: napkins, napkin rings, paperclips, staples, and other miscellaneous trash.
At this point, it’s pretty clear that this isn’t a cooking show, so contestants are all business. They know there’s a recipe and they know what they have to do in order to win the challenge. What they don’t know is the difference between a deli sandwich and a BLT. That’s where Waxman comes in. He provides the recipes and instructs them on how to make them. But while his expertise and guidance help them make the meal, the true beauty comes from watching them work.
The contestants each go to work in their own separate kitchens and learn how to make the dishes, from stapling their napkins together to creating a cocktail from bottles of water. And while you’re watching, the show provides some context for the meals. You learn about the items they’re making and how they’re preparing them. It’s interesting, because it helps you understand why these items are used, how they’re made, and what they taste like.
If you’ve ever wondered why your cookbook has all of these ingredients, but you don’t actually know what they taste like, this show will give you the answer. This isn’t like other cooking shows where you watch as people cook. This is about watching people make something. And it’s a lot of fun to watch.
It’s like one of those haunted house films where a man walks into an office, and then the lights go out and a man walks out the other side. You get to know the guy, and his office supplies.
9 Signs You Should Invest in buffalo wings and ranch dipping sauce

A group of pirates opens a theme park but struggles with modern technology, especially when a terrorist tries to destroy the park.
Xander Drake has his life all figured out. The world is his playground and when he’s bored he makes his own fun. When he’s bored and alone he sets his sights on beautiful women. That is until he meets Jennifer McAdams. Xander can’t take his eyes off of her. This is the first time since he was a teenager that he’s wanted to settle down. He knows she’s the one, but when he follows her home to meet her family he gets the shock of his life when he walks into her home and runs into her step brother, Matt Brady. Matt is none other than the man he has been chasing for a year. The same man he set out to destroy.
Matt Brady is a man who has to watch over his little sister at all times. He hasn’t lived a life of his own since the death of his parents. Now he is 28 and still can’t live a life without fear. With the darkness he carries inside of him, Matt does what he has to in order to survive. He makes money as a drug dealer, but nothing compares to the feeling he gets when he sells women.
“I will make her scream out my name, Matt.”
“What if I told you that she was already mine? What if I told you that I knew what she wanted?” Xander sat up and faced Matt.
“I think I’d put you out of your misery. If you knew what I wanted then you would know that she’s already with me.”
“How can she be with you if I’ve never met you? All I have to do is walk into her house and her family just so happens to let me in. Her brother is a man I’ve been chasing for the last year. The same man that I’ve been trying to destroy. You, my friend, are the one I will get to meet when she’s ready for me to have her.”
“You won’t have her and neither will I, but I promise you this, you will suffer like you’ve never suffered before. She is mine and she will stay mine until she tells me that she wants out.”
“You know, the longer we talk the more I don’t believe you know what you’re talking about.”
“Baby Girl, that’s my name for her.”
Matt sat up and looked straight into Xander’s eyes. “I’m telling you now, you don’t touch her and you will regret the day you ever met her.”
“Okay, I think you’ve made your point. I don’t know why I ever thought you were real.”
“You’ll know that I’m real the first time you meet her.”
Xander stood up. “I don’t think so. You know what? I don’t need to meet her in order to take her.” Xander looked over at Matt and smiled.
Matt stood up and wiped the blood off of his face. He couldn’t believe how crazy this guy was. All Matt wanted to do was fuck the girl, but this guy wanted to take her away from him.
“I don’t need to touch her to have her, all I need to do is show her what she wants. When she wants me, she will want me. She will crawl up to my bed and beg to be touched by me, and I will make her scream out my name, Matt. You, my friend, will be a memory.”
I’ve been writing for as long as I can remember. I’ve dabbled in the usual stuff. Short stories, book reviews, fan fiction and more. I never thought I could actually write a full length book. One day I just started writing my first book.
Website * Goodreads * Facebook * Twitter
I’ve been doing more with my blog. I’m writing reviews on other people’s books, participating in blog tours and things. I’ve met some of my favorite authors and have even been asked to BETA their books for them. My readers keep growing and I love it. I’m doing what I love and I love what I’m doing.
Other than that, I’m going to college online. I’m working on my degree in English. I want to get it so I can go to graduate school. I want to learn as much as I can about writing.
They’ve always been important to me. My friends tell me that I talk to them too much and that’s why they aren’t my friends anymore. I don’t know how many times I’ve tried to change my ways. I’ve read so many books about how to be a good author and not to talk about my books so much, but it just doesn’t happen. I talk about them because it’s my escape. I live in my mind and I escape to my books so that I can relax.
Right now, I’m working on Dangerous Love. It’s the next book in the Darker Love series.
Book #1 Blurb
Doctor Madison Daniels has been hiding from the world for four long years. Her husband died in a tragic accident and ever since then she’s been a recluse. She’s finally coming back out into the world and wants to be an example of courage. She’s going to be the first female sports doctor in the NFL.
Aaron Thompson is the starting quarterback of the Seattle Sentinels. All his life he’s been putting women and football ahead of each other. He was on his way to being the starting quarterback of the Seahawks when he wrecked his car and his knee was severely damaged. He’s on the mend and he wants to give this football thing another chance.
Madison and Aaron’s lives collide when Aaron crashes into her car and destroys it. After that, they can’t seem to keep their hands off of each other. They are in an unforeseen love affair that neither of them can deny. But with the enemies on the field, both of their careers are at stake.
That I’m normal. I’m an everyday normal person that gets up everyday and goes to work.
I think the fact that I make my blog so interactive makes it different than everyone else’s.
If I had to choose between the two, I would have to say that football players are more exciting than serial killers.
I would say that the Alaskan bush pilot is the most realistic guy I could become. I’m fascinated by the Alaskan bush.
Out of the two, I think I would choose the mysterious athlete over the serial killer. That way I know that if I did get out of my marriage that I wouldn’t be put away in jail.
I’d probably choose to go back in time and be a pro football player.
My family and friends. My husband and children are my life.
I’d have to go with the Alaskan bush pilot. It’s so much easier to fly to another state than it is to fly to another country.
“Well, well, look who finally showed up.”
She lifted her head and tried to ignore the man standing next to her. She saw that it was Aaron.
She turned and started to get up. He put his hand on her shoulder.
“Sit down and enjoy the show.” He smirked.
She frowned and stayed sitting on the bench.
“I can’t believe you didn’t know I was here,” Aaron said.
Madison could feel herself getting a little flushed. “I didn’t have any idea that you were coming. I wanted to go alone.”
“Why?” Aaron asked, leaning forward on his bench.
“Why? You know why.” Madison’s heart was racing.
Aaron laughed. “I think you should get up and go to your seat.”
“You want me to get up and go?” Madison asked, putting her hand on her heart. “Are you serious? I have to go to your seat now?”
“It’s like you’re forcing me to sit with you,” he said, looking over at her.
“I’m not forcing you to sit with me,” Madison said. “I’m asking you if you want to sit with me.”
“Are you sure about that? You know, I can stay.”
Madison could feel her heart fluttering. “You can stay,” she said. “I think it would be best for both of us if you stayed.”
Aaron got up and came over to the bench. He pulled out the chair next to her and sat down. She could feel his breath on her neck.
“This is a first for me.” Aaron smiled. “I’ve never had a lady turn me down and ask me to sit next to her.”
“Well, that’s a first for me, too. I’ve never had a guy ask me to sit with him.”
Aaron leaned in closer to her. “Well, I’m glad to be the first.” He smirked.
Madison’s heart raced again.

Carved into the canyon walls are symbols that were believed to hold magical power. The images used in carvings have been attributed to various gods and goddesses and include that of serpents, birds, rams, goats, and other animals. Rock carvings represent a key point in the history of the Kingdom of Khajuraho and of India. They survived only because of the solitude and rugged landscape of the region. Much of the other evidence of the era has been destroyed by the passage of time.
A stone carving of a temple in the Khajuraho group of monuments.
Khajuraho consists of 85 temples that have remained intact. Several of the buildings are in ruins but can still be visited. They are made up of nine groups of temples, all constructed between the 9th and 11th centuries. The temples were the religious and cultural centers of the city-state. There are also several smaller groups of temples around the city. The largest and oldest group is Khajuraho, which has ten Hindu and one Jain temple. These temples are built of sandstone, which is somewhat porous and could easily be eroded. This, combined with the monsoons that sweep through the region, has created the deteriorated condition of many of the buildings.
Khajuraho is home to several groups of temples.
Today, the Khajuraho temples are considered a tourist site and are the most visited of all the temple complexes in India. To protect the remaining structures from damage, the site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. Most of the temples that remain intact are Hindu structures and reflect the presence of two major Hindu sects during this period, Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The Hindu temples are dedicated to various deities including Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, and Durga.
The Khajuraho Group of Monuments.
The Khajuraho temple complex features a diverse range of temple styles and is a recognized centre of Hindu art. Khajuraho temples feature pillars, walls, and ceilings decorated with images of couples engaging in sex, with the bodies of the women shown. These paintings and carvings are one of the primary reasons why the temple complex is a major tourist attraction today. The artists who created the carvings depicted only the bodies of the women because the deities themselves did not engage in sexual activity. This makes the temple art unique because most of the other artwork that has been discovered from this era is devoid of such images. The artwork was influenced by the Moghul Empire and was part of a tradition in which the sculptures were displayed in everyday life.
Inside a temple.
The 10th-century Sun Temple in Modhera, Gujarat, is one of the best examples of the Shiva temple that has survived the centuries. In 1988, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple is dedicated to Surya, or the sun god, and is situated at the site of a previous settlement. The site of the temple was chosen because it was located near the village of Modhera and on a ridge along the banks of the Tapovan River. There are no other temples nearby and this location ensures that the temple complex remains isolated from other civilizations and can only be reached by winding dirt roads and footpaths.
The Surya Temple at Modhera, India.
Another example of a temple that was built at the time is the Konark Sun Temple. This temple was constructed at the end of the 13th century. During the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple's design includes an inverted chariot with twelve wheels and eleven horses. This design reflects the importance of the sun god.
The Pattadakal Temple, India.
The Pattadakal Temple is the oldest of all temples built during the Gupta Empire period and features seven complexes built between the 8th and 10th centuries. The temple complex is situated in the state of Karnataka and is considered an important site for the study of the ancient period and the evolution of temple architecture. The temple complex is made up of a total of seven temples that were built in dedication to the deity Siva. The temples are built of rock and brick and feature extensive wall paintings that are visible on the exterior walls.
Temple.
Many of the carvings in the temples depict scenes of sexual activity. A common depiction includes two women engaging in sex with a man whose face has been obscured. The artwork, which has been described as an "erotic marathon," reflects the carver's knowledge of Hindu literature and mythology and includes scenes of love, beauty, and, of course, eroticism. The depictions of eroticism in the carvings of the temples are similar to other ancient works of art and were intended to celebrate life and portray religious rites.
Khajuraho temples feature pillars, walls, and ceilings decorated with images of couples engaging in sex.
The temples also feature images of the erotic nymphs, who were known as Apsaras. These nymphs were believed to wander the earth in a state of eternal youth and beauty. They served as a reminder of the enigmatic nature of the female body. These statuesque images were created with the intent of appealing to the senses of the beholders, and their full-frontal nudity is not surprising in light of the fact that the arts of the time were considered sacred and were for worship.
Some of the carvings depict couples engaging in sex.
The rock carvings are often said to have been used to teach the young the sexual arts. According to tradition, the Khajuraho temples served as centers for learning and were used to teach the young the art of making love. Sexual knowledge was acquired through erotic sculptures and paintings that were spread throughout the temples. The temples are a reflection of the philosophical and artistic traditions of the era.
Several of the rock carvings represent Apsaras.
The Hindu deity, Shiva, was the most important deity in the Khajuraho temples. He was said to be the supreme being who created the world. As a result, the temples were known as Shaiva temples. He was often portrayed as a lord of love and his fertility symbolized the creation of the universe. His influence is obvious in many of the rock carvings, which have been associated with Shiva, including those that show him standing on top of a winding snake.
The Khajuraho temples were built in the 9th and 11th centuries.
The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is one of the most famous structures in the Khajuraho group of temples. It is believed to have been built in the 11th century and is named after Lord Shiva. The name Kandariya Mahadeva refers to the "princes of the Kandariya" and "princes of the Hindu clan," and the structure was built for the king's pleasure. The temple was originally built as an outdoor shrine.
The carvings depict scenes from the lives of ordinary people.
The carvings of the Khajuraho temples were created between the 9th and 11th centuries. Many of these rock carvings have been attributed to different Hindu gods and goddesses, including Indra, Surya, and Brahma. Many of the statues feature intricate details that depict the activities of ordinary people, including those engaged in agricultural work and social interaction.
The temples were constructed of sandstone.
In the 1980s, UNESCO declared the Khajuraho group of monuments a World Heritage Site. The temples feature a range of architectural styles and designs, including those with a 50-foot spire and elaborate sculptures. There are also many other temples around the city, including two more that are dedicated to Lord Shiva. These temples are made of sandstone and the most popular of the temples are the ones with five spires.
The Khajuraho temples were used as a training ground for religious leaders.
The Khajuraho temples are considered one of the most beautiful monuments in the world. They are dedicated to Lord Vishnu and feature intricate details and carvings that depict the activities of ordinary people. The Khajuraho temples were used as a training ground for religious leaders.

Following the melody, the traveler finds the avalanche of a bright spring, a primitive summer with the length of a few weeks, and the sudden coming of a grayness all but perpetual.
Though he is tempted to believe that this state will endure, last forever, for he has seen that it changes nothing and has suffered no deaths, he has every reason to doubt this. In fact, a few light-colored stars overhead and a sound of birds in the trees have given him the impression that it is already fading. But he is sure that when it leaves, it will leave nothing behind, no evidence that it had been and no open gate for the melody that will come afterward.
During the grayness he rides a horse along the roads and dreams his dreams. Some of these he shares with the traveler, who is not inclined to believe that it is still spring.
A luminous evening followed by a dreamless night. The following morning a day such as he has not seen for six months. Such a day could not last forever and soon passed. Evening without the luminous light, but not night. Another day. All of these were delightful, and a fine day.
The morning afterward is cold and gray. A day such as has not been seen for twenty years. It would be more comfortable to sit inside and be warm, but the traveler refuses to believe that the light will not return. He is not at ease in the city he rides through, nor in the village that he sometimes visits. All daylight is not dead, though he has not seen the light. He does not know the way to the gray land, nor to the city that is within, and soon he must go home and walk under the strange, brief stars.
The melody travels southward.
Some travelers are good at finding their way. They may be travelers for days, even weeks, and do not lose their way. Others are lost the first day, and some never find their way back.
At this time, a younger traveler is adrift, though he knows the melody. To remain on the earth is to listen to the melody, to journey. To leave it is to abandon the melody, and to fall silent, cut off from its strength. This is not a fate that he has chosen.
He has been given leave, he thinks.
And this is not unpleasant, because a lot of other things are not unpleasant, but then he remembers that he once thought of the roads themselves as unpleasant, and it makes him think that this is only an unpleasant feeling, because he still thinks that the roads are unpleasant.
In order to avoid thinking of the roads, he thinks of the music, but the music is, after all, only a thought, so he thinks of the color, and the people, and he has a feeling that is better than either, that is like a soft tide of happiness and melancholy, and when the tide pulls out again he has not noticed that it has left, so when he realizes this, he is happy again.
The melody flows as it has, as it must. It is long but is not always the same length. Sometimes it lasts for days, sometimes for weeks, and the young traveler thinks that this must have some sort of meaning, even though it seems to be random, and not the same meaning each time, and when he thinks about this for too long, he does not have a way to think about what the melody might be, so he does not think about it, but instead he follows it and thinks that there must be some meaning, and what he finds is that he is always finding something beautiful and interesting, and so if he thinks about what he is thinking about, it changes.
Sometimes it is not the same melody at all, but an echo or a knocking or a call, an echo of an echo of an echo. He is sure that this is important, but the echo does not go on long enough for him to be sure.
But every time the echo does go on long enough for him to notice, he wishes that it did not. He does not like to be apart from the main melody.
He never sleeps or eats. He walks and walks and walks, and the only thing he needs is the melody.
The young traveler thinks of what happened to him before, and he is sure that it will happen again.
Before, he was going to be a strong, tall man. That is what he was told, and he was taught to dream this. Then the music, which he listened to every day, which he always listened to, brought him a story of a woman who was always in danger, of a woman who grew old too soon and a man who stayed too long.
He used to laugh at this story, but he has listened to it many times now. He has forgotten most of it. He knows how to make the song go away, because he has learned a little about that. But there is a long part of the story that he does not remember, the part where the woman grows old. When he learns that part, he will laugh at the song again, but for now, it does not end that way, so he does not laugh.
Now, when he is no longer a boy, he does not have to sleep or eat, and he does not mind. He has a hunger for the melody that the man had for the woman. It is all that he cares about.
He walks, and walks, and walks.
He does not know how long he has walked, or how far. He tries to count days, but he loses count, for there is nothing to count except the song. He has walked past the place where he fell and where the melody once stopped, and he has not fallen. He is sure that he will fall, so he does not try to go further. Whenever he sees something strange, he goes to it, and there is nothing strange in the roads, for they are always the same, but the people in the roads are strange, so he goes and talks to them.
They are all like himself, as though it is the melody that makes them, but they do not know how far they have traveled. He asks them, and he learns something about the melody.
He learns that it cannot go very far, but that it can change.
Sometimes, it goes only a short distance and then returns to where it started, so that one part is close to another. The melody is like a net, or a string. Or a chain.
But that is not always the case.
Sometimes it moves one place far away, and when it reaches that place it ends. It is finished. It stops.
The traveler thinks of what is in between, and he tries to imagine what the distance between that place and the place that the melody ends at. He imagines a great big hole, but that is wrong. There is nothing to the place that the melody ends, for it has nothing to do with the melody, and he knows that he has gone too far to ask anyone, for there is no one who knows more than he, and he does not like to ask. He does not like to admit that he does not know.
He walks, and walks, and walks.
Once, a few days ago, a rooster crowed and said the name of the sun. The young traveler had never seen a rooster, so he is not sure how to interpret the crowing, but he is sure that the sun is not, and has never been, named. He thinks that the crowing could be part of the melody, but he is not sure.
When he walks, he thinks about the past and the future. He tries to figure out the past. It is so strange. It is full of signs and things that are hard to explain. How can a stone tell him what the melody is? The stone tells him nothing about the melody. He wonders how he could ever believe that the melody was hidden in a stone, but he knows that it was. He knows that he is where he is meant to be. He is listening to the melody.
He listens, and walks.
In the city he first sees another traveler. There are travelers in the village, and it is easy to imagine them. There are travelers who look like the young traveler. But this one is an older man, and when he sees him, he thinks he is the traveler from the sky. He is sure that he has seen him, in the music, the way he was before, the way he looked when he left.
There is no one in the sky any longer. There are no songs, no dreams. The man is gone.
He is gone for good, and there is no more melody.
When the young traveler sees the man, he walks toward him.
The man does not see him, because he is not listening, he is looking at a stone.
The young traveler thinks about what has happened. He thinks that the melody is gone, but that is wrong. The melody has not disappeared. It is somewhere else. The young traveler does not think of the stone as an echo, because the stone is not a song. It is a stone, and the stone does not move. The stone does not move because the melody does not move. He knows that the stone cannot have anything

Lost in the labyrinth, echoes of footsteps. Sitting alone in the bathroom, lost without a purpose. Fighting the dark inside of me, fighting for sanity. Nine nights of unrest, knowing I’ll never be the same. Incomplete and incomplete. Find the courage, find the strength, find a way out of the maze.

Hovering above the clouds, the city of tomorrow
Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the key to energy security
After a short hop in a small plane, Tong Guan goes underground. It’s noon on a Saturday, and the day’s schedule calls for taking a closer look at the underground tunnels at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. But now Guan and his colleagues are seeing these tunnels for the first time. They stand in a small cave-like room, a few feet above the floor. They’re surrounded by white tubes, bristling with wires and filled with gases that accelerate ions around 20 million times each second. The detectors record each collision, creating a fingerprint of the molecules.
It is a balmy 64 degrees, yet Guan is wearing a sweater. His colleagues are dressed much the same. It’s been cold in the mountain tunnels, and the researchers are comfortable. Yet this is a chilly scene from a scientific point of view. The researchers can detect less than 1 in 100,000 carbon atoms, and the thermal energy of a tablet of butter. They’re looking for trace components that, if they existed, would have been shattered by the decay of heavy elements as they coalesced in the early universe.
But Guan is one of the few researchers who can detect these ultra-lightweight atomic fragments. “For something lighter than hydrogen, you can’t do it with optical laser techniques,” Guan explains. “You have to use radio waves.”
Guan is a member of the lab’s newly formed radio frequency acceleration mass spectroscopy group, directed by Lynn Mills, a member of the lab’s senior science leadership team. This research is part of the lab’s ongoing work to understand how matter forms and behaves, from the outer reaches of the universe to the smallest subatomic particles.
Guan is one of only about 150 people in the world who know how to operate these instruments. This is what makes Oak Ridge National Laboratory so special: The lab’s unique instrumentation makes it possible for researchers to investigate materials and processes at the edge of scientific discovery.

The first team of chemists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory were physicists. At the beginning of the Manhattan Project in 1942, Robert R. Wilson was among the 27 scientists recruited to work on nuclear weapons at Oak Ridge. From 1944 until 1951, Wilson served as head of the chemistry group, which was the forerunner of today’s Chemical and Engineering Division.
The chemistry division pioneered research in fields like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which is used to understand how atoms and molecules behave in reactions that fuel energy and technological transformation. The chemistry group also has a long history of studying a wide range of materials. This past summer, researchers working with acoustics, chemistry and nuclear engineering confirmed the density of liquid water at 3,700 atmospheres—20,000 times the pressure at sea level—a record high.
But the big milestone for the lab in 1952 was the invention of electromagnetic mass spectroscopy, a technique that involves accelerating ions and their fragments toward a detector. The eventual goal of the project was to figure out how the elements were formed during the Big Bang. By learning about the creation of elements, the scientists were hoping to create a new form of chemistry.
They didn’t have to travel far to unearth some of the world’s purest elemental matter. Nestled deep within a high-security, 34-square-mile area of East Tennessee, the lab sits on a hill about 10 miles from the site of the lab’s first experiments.
These experiments were the first step in understanding nuclear energy. In the 1930s, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt explaining the theory of how uranium could be used as a source of energy for the production of nuclear bombs. In 1942, two years after the famed letter, Wilson began his work as the lab’s first nuclear chemist.
The lab’s history—and future—is entwined with that of nuclear energy. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Energy designated the lab as a multi-program research facility, meaning its scientists can collaborate across many fields, including nuclear science, physics and chemistry.
The lab has a close working relationship with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest public power company in the nation. The TVA operates five nuclear reactors in its commercial fleet, with two more under construction. And the lab and TVA are exploring the potential of nuclear fusion energy, which could provide safe and plentiful energy for millions of years.
If atomic physicists had their way, the lab would close its doors. After the Manhattan Project, the scientists and their scientific achievements became a target for bombers and bomb-makers. But World War II ended quickly. The scientists had won the war, but lost the peace.
Some years later, in 1946, the scientists got their peace. They founded the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies to continue studying basic science and advance peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
This year, the lab is marking 70 years since it opened its doors. As the lab has grown, its mission has too. And that mission continues to be driven by a goal to be an American leader in science and technology.
The first step was establishing research, development and technology initiatives across many fields, including nuclear and energy sciences; advanced materials; manufacturing; and biological and environmental science. Then came the “atomic discovery” of 1952. The first team of chemists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory were physicists. At the beginning of the Manhattan Project in 1942, Robert R. Wilson was among the 27 scientists recruited to work on nuclear weapons at Oak Ridge. From 1944 until 1951, Wilson served as head of the chemistry group, which was the forerunner of today’s Chemical and Engineering Division. The chemistry division pioneered research in fields like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which is used to understand how atoms and molecules behave in reactions that fuel energy and technological transformation. The chemistry group also has a long history of studying a wide range of materials. This past summer, researchers working with acoustics, chemistry and nuclear engineering confirmed the density of liquid water at 3,700 atmospheres—20,000 times the pressure at sea level—a record high.
In 1976, the lab expanded its mission by establishing the Environmental Sciences Division. Today, the researchers in that division are the lab’s environmental stewards. They also lead the lab’s research on water resource management, aquatic ecosystems and air pollution and climate change.
The lab’s research in biological and environmental science includes the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science Bioenergy Technologies Office. The team’s work involves assessing the potential of new materials to improve efficiencies of biological and thermochemical conversion technologies, identifying best practices to improve overall biofuel yield and creating innovative biomass harvesting technologies. The researchers are also looking at new materials to create more efficient lithium ion batteries for the transportation and grid storage sectors.
Forty-two years after it first opened its doors, the lab began its next research expansion—this time into chemistry, advanced materials and nuclear energy.
By 1970, the lab had built more than 100 structures, including the headquarters of the now-named Chemical and Engineering Division, and the tallest building in Oak Ridge.
In the decades to come, the lab would continue to expand, with an emphasis on nuclear energy, chemistry and advanced materials. With 119 buildings and 136 tenant laboratories, the lab is home to 2,700 people, including 1,200 staff scientists and 1,300 staff and student researchers.
The researchers are making advances that include creating more efficient battery materials, developing technologies to manufacture large-area flexible electronics and increasing the yield of biomass-derived products.
The lab has also pushed the boundaries of computing, developing computer software that has enabled industry and academic partners to significantly speed up the development of new materials.
But while the lab’s location is unchanged, the mission is ever-changing. Today, the researchers continue to advance our understanding of the universe

The bustling marketplace was alive with the sounds and smells of a weekly visit. The craftsmen, basket weavers and herbalists would have been working in their typical clothing to build or repair their tools. It is thought that women would have been wearing traditional Haida dress. Historically, we know that the women of Haida society were beautifully and colorfully dressed, fully covered by intricately beaded jackets and rain capes. The exact color and type of clothing is unknown, but the design of the capes is evident in the decorative designs of the tools. Some of the figures are dressed in typical clothing from 100 years ago and others are wearing simpler clothing from centuries ago. Some of the tools are representative of tools that were found in the Tikigaq site, and some are completely speculative.
The tools are all made from either wood or bone and the tip of the tools were traditionally made from hard stone. Bone tools were more durable than stone ones, but the latter were stronger than wood. Like the craftsmen of the community, there are warriors carrying wooden spears and swords. Other soldiers are shown with shields and wooden helmets. It is also known that the Haida used natural rock shelters for defense. The Haida would also have been given weapons to defend the village, just as they are in this piece.

The hidden garden behind the mansion was known for its rare, endangered plants, including this pitcher plant, a climbing vine called kangaroo grass and several varieties of bee orchids.
Among the world’s most famous orchids were several varieties discovered by Richard Fox, a horticulturist and avid collector. Fox’s favored white lady’s slipper and lilac lady’s slipper were considered his most prized.
A winding path led to a small pond and a swinging bench, both popular photo spots for visitors.
An oak tree known as Mr. Bovey was planted on Mr. Bovey’s land in 1844. The tree’s limbs bent over and touched the ground in the center, making it look like a large umbrella.
The mansion also housed the state’s oldest rocking chair and the state’s oldest pump organ. The rocking chair was a gift from Mary Holland, the original owner’s daughter.
Part of a dumbwaiter is still in the kitchen.
One of the upstairs bathrooms had a chair built into the ceiling, allowing the occupant to flush the toilet.
The attic stairway was narrow enough that Mr. Bovey built a removable staircase to help his wife get through the opening.
After her husband’s death, Mrs. Bovey kept the place and divided the house into apartments. One of those tenants was Johnny Stilwell, the nephew of the famous Mississippi comedian George “Boss” Holliday. Stilwell became an attorney and spent years representing Sonny and Cher and traveling the world. He donated his collection of cherished Indian artifacts to the museum.
After Mrs. Bovey’s death, the house sat vacant for about 20 years, and vandals and squatters moved in. In 1977, Mayor Frank Melton reopened the site as the Biedenharn Museum.

In a quiet village, a rumor about a magical well starts to spread, changing the lives of its residents forever…
Everyone loves a good tale. But when a young stranger named Colby Blackburn arrives in the small, sleepy village of Blackwell, the people come to believe he's the village's long-lost legendary healer and savior, Colby of Colby-by-the-Well. Suddenly, the village is revitalized. The sick are cured, the poor are fed, and the villagers' spirits are lifted.
The son of an impoverished miller, Colby has his own ideas of his destiny and what he believes in. But he may be too stubborn to admit that maybe—just maybe—there's more to the Blackwell legend than anyone has ever suspected.
In this tale of love, mystery, and magic, from best-selling author Stephenia H. McGee, a dark secret from the past comes to light, just as a dangerous illness starts spreading through the village. With the help of Faith Henderson and her generous heart, Colby must unravel the mysteries of his past and of a certain well that lies hidden in the woods. Will he lose the one woman he loves? Or will his faith and love for this village finally help him find the well of hope and healing he's been searching for his entire life?
With evocative descriptions of the English countryside and full of tense, unexpected twists, this heartfelt story of magic and miracle will enchant fans of Julie Klassen and Carrie Turansky.

For those who read historical fiction, this book should appeal. I liked the themes of faith and finding one's place in life, and I always enjoy stories set in England. However, there were times when the author's use of the word "well" became repetitive, as well as the description of Colby as having no morals. His actions suggest that he is a nice guy, but I found it unnecessary to say that he has no morals. The romance between the main character and Faith moves very slowly. In one scene, Faith kisses Colby and the next day Colby decides not to go to her home. The village is basically a bunch of gossipers and someone tells Faith's father that Colby and Faith have had an argument. It seemed like everyone was telling everyone else's business. The characters have no discretion. The plot was interesting with the mysteries and dangers of a dangerous illness, but the execution was a little slow and felt drawn out.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I really liked the characters, so it was a little too slow for me. I wonder if the reworking of the story might be a little bit of her fault as an author.

The ancient tree stood tall, bearing witness to centuries of human folly and the natural progression of life as it transformed from sunny spring to foggy autumn. There, he sat for two hundred years, lost in his own thoughts, awaiting the arrival of his own two hundredth birthday. It seemed like an eternity ago that he had looked down on a forest filled with possibility, thinking himself to be immortal, but for the first time in those two centuries, he was wrong.
“Two hundred years,” he said to himself. “I never thought I’d live this long.”
But as he looked out over the city of Lagunitas, whose fire pits now were dust, he could almost see the treetops of the dense woods that once covered the area. And so he set out to re-establish the town, and to make it a place that would be remembered for hundreds of years to come.
A strange feeling of connectedness to something larger than himself filled his heart as he roamed the city, his movements natural and fluid as he gauged the local disposition, balancing society’s expectations with his own. He soon recognized that a great many souls had a bright, optimistic and productive outlook on life, in harmony with the cycles of nature. But for some reason, a peculiar few remained cynical and sarcastic, often defying the most basic rules of societal harmony, sometimes just for the sake of defiance. And because of this, an entirely unique system of morality was born.
Over the years, The Community for the Adequate Defense of Oddity (CADO) would become a leading community center for local business owners, artists and healthcare practitioners, known in no small part due to its strict enforcement of its unusual rule set, a list of taboos that even the most cynical of oddballs were sure to find violating.
Treat others with respect, but don’t trust them.
Don’t litter in the streets, unless you’re sharing your stuff with another person.
Don’t criticize the love interest of another community member, but do try to defame the “not-love interest” of said member.
Do not challenge the stranger sitting in the local café.
Don’t compliment yourself, unless you’re being paid.
Whenever the sun rose in the morning, as it had done countless times in the past, the ancient tree woke from his slumber, and spread his roots out underground, reaching out to the vast subterranean network of roots and worms that criss-crossed the town. The old tree moved with purpose, just like the citizens of CADO, with a vision for a future yet to come. He felt a strong connection to this place, a place that was far greater than himself.
And it was in this moment, just as the sun crested the horizon, that the tree realized what it had not known for centuries… that time did not flow at a constant pace, but that it had begun to slip through his hands, as if he was a child, and he no longer had control. He would never see his two hundred and first birthday.

Early morning fog unveils a landscape filled with fields and gardens.
Although it was pitch black and foggy in the morning, I was still able to use a small number of autumn leaves as a backdrop for this portrait.
The leaves on the lower branches of this magnolia tree will soon be gone, but some of the higher leaves will still be here for awhile.

The melody of an old piano tune brings back memories of the pain that killed her mother, but she’ll do anything to recover her lost music—even if it means she might die trying.

Even so, she fell in love with him…and before he could tell her the truth about his incredible abilities, they were torn apart. Now, back in her hometown, Brandon is the only one who can help her.

Unraveling the mysteries of the deep sea, researchers find 56 million-year-old marine fossil
19 August 2021 | Story by Tamsin Oswald. Photo Supplied.
A team of researchers from the University of Johannesburg (UJ) has identified a new species of fossil fish in the Elgin sedimentary basin (ESM), a geological formation dating back approximately 56 million years.
This discovery was made in collaboration with researchers from the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of Durham.
The ESM is located off the southern coast of Africa. There are similar deposits in Antarctica, which also produce fossils from the same period. These findings were published in the Journal of the Geological Society.
Lead author Professor Johan Lubbe, from the Department of Geosciences at UJ’s Institute for Geoscience, says the discovery “opens up the possibility of finding new fossil sites in previously overlooked parts of South Africa”.
Discovering fossils
Until the new find, the number of fossils from the ESM was restricted to three species of brachiopods – bivalved organisms with two shells, which lie dormant on the sea floor.
According to Lubbe, the area is only known for “very limited faunal fossil assemblages” – as little as 5% of the total fauna in the area is recorded.
This situation can create gaps in our understanding of ancient marine communities.
The oldest records for the ESM date back to the early Eocene epoch, which began approximately 56 million years ago. The fauna was very diverse in this area, and researchers consider this “an opportunity to further our understanding of the diversity and biogeography of the Southern Hemisphere in the early Eocene”.
The team analysed 50 samples from two 10-metre-deep boreholes, one in the Cape Peninsula area and the other on the southern coast near Cape Town. It was this analysis that yielded the fossil record and allowed the new species to be identified.
New species found in ancient sedimentary basin
According to Lubbe, this is a good discovery for a few reasons.
“Firstly, it confirms the presence of fossils from this fauna in this region of South Africa.
“Secondly, this [discovery] shows that the ESM may not be as fossil-barren as previously believed and that there may be more fossils from the ESM awaiting discovery.
“Thirdly, it has been previously suggested that this faunal assemblage is closely related to that of Antarctica. Our discovery adds weight to this theory and opens up the possibility of finding new fossil sites in previously overlooked parts of South Africa,” he says.
The fossil site from which the specimens were found.
The fossil in question was one of the best examples of brachiopod preserved in the region, and is the only brachiopod specimen ever to be found in this part of the ESM. The fossil bears an uncanny resemblance to a living species called Polyptychotrypa antarctica.
“This new fossil species is described as the only new species ever reported from the [ESM],” says Lubbe.
The researchers found the specimen “in a deposit otherwise rich in brachiopods. The biostratigraphic date range is near the boundary between the Ypresian and Lutetian age facies, interpreted as having been deposited in a quiet, brackish to marine lagoon during high sea-level.”
The fossil resembles the fossil Polyptychotrypa antarctica.
The fossil resembles Polyptychotrypa antarctica, from the same part of the world, suggesting a possible link between the two faunas. This is despite their differences in the geographical location, the timing and the types of sediment that are present.
“While not showing a close family relationship, our finding does provide a potential connection between the deep water assemblage found in South Africa and Antarctica during the early Eocene, which is interesting in its own right,” says Lubbe.
The researchers stress that this discovery opens up the possibility of finding other fossils in previously overlooked parts of South Africa.
“Finding new fossil sites in previously overlooked parts of South Africa has always been a dream of mine,” says Lubbe.
“However, we don’t just want to find more fossils from the Elgin formation, but more fossils from the ESM as a whole, which has not received much attention in recent decades.”
UCT’s Professor Marina Joubert, who co-authored the paper, says the study opens up the possibility of identifying previously unknown fossils of the early Eocene in new parts of the southern coast of South Africa.
“The Early Eocene benthic fauna is one of the least known in the world and even less known in the southern hemisphere, but has been found in very limited places, namely South Africa, Namibia, Australia and Antarctica,” says Joubert.
Both Lubbe and Joubert agree that the fossils from the ESM, and from other areas of South Africa, are of high value, and can help us to better understand our evolution and paleogeography.
“It is exciting to reconstruct the ancient seascape of the ESM, which has not yet been fully understood. The new finds have opened the door to a lot of potential for reconstructing what the ESM looked like in the early Eocene,” says Lubbe.

A diary from the 18th century reveals life stories and secrets about the fate of thousands of people, whose remains were scattered in a cemetery outside the walls of Vienna.
A remarkable encounter took place one late spring evening in 1752. An elderly man was strolling past the gates of an abandoned hospital complex in Vienna. In the dilapidated gatehouse he encountered a young, intellectually promising physician who was treating the bubonic plague there. They soon became friends. One of them was a writer, the other a physician. The younger man was later to be known by the name of his mentor, who was born with a classical sounding family name, but took his cognomen from the county in which he was born.
What interested the elderly writer in the plague hospital and the young physician in the records of its patients was the same: the fate of the people who had perished from the plague, as well as the lack of a systematic and comprehensive medical record.
By his own admission, the historian was a disappointed, ill-fated scribe and, lacking trust in the so-called “men of power”, a chronicler of the poor, and of their virtues and their misfortunes. Since this, in his view, was the only genuine truth, he produced a narrative account of the hardships and suffering of his fellow men, which was published after his death in 1782. The name of the historian who wrote the first illustrated manuscript which tells the stories of the poor people of the 18th century – the author is unknown, the manuscript is known by the name of the hospital where he wrote it: Spitalgasse.
In 1731 a new, grand baroque wing was built to house the patients of the Vienna general hospital, known as the Spital. This was located outside the city walls, in what is now known as Favoriten. At the same time, the dilapidated old hospital building and the hospital complex were closed down. Its desolate, wind-swept compound served as an overcrowded, filthy graveyard in which the coffins of thousands of plague victims had already been buried. Many of the plague graves were robbed, with grave-robbers digging up the corpses of the recently deceased and selling the coffins as funeral equipment. These became the property of “makers of mock” – puppet makers – who used the lumber to make theatrical productions.
Napoleon’s army destroyed the building, which was the last surviving structure of the once-vast baroque complex. It was made into a cemetery after the Napoleonic wars. The site of the cemetery, which has been abandoned since the Second World War, is in the shadow of the modern Viennese Ring Road, and is just across the street from a neo-Gothic church. It has been neglected, but there have been attempts to redress its abandonment in the last few years.
Spitalgasse 31 was the result of a chance encounter in 1752, the year of Bach’s death, between a doctor of law and a writer who spent his life as a scribe. The writer was the elderly court historian, the author of the Singspiele opera libretti, C.M. Weidmann, who had a brief, failed career as a playwright and composer. He wrote three operas in Venice, but became an almost anonymous historian with a string of unsuccessful productions in Vienna.
Spitalgasse may not be a masterpiece of journalism in the modern sense, but it is nevertheless a masterpiece. It is a saga of 18th-century Vienna and its 18th-century poor people. It is also a time capsule of the period, a discovery of the book-form, a highly artistic document of the times in which it was written, an observation of human nature and a theatricalised representation of poverty and despair.
The author used a sober, classical text to tell stories, and described the plight of the “deficient poor”, i.e. those people who were unable to work. Weidmann described the suffering of the poor in the city and outside it, in monasteries and hospitals, and told of life in the countryside, where the poor were forced to beg and grovel.
In the introduction to Spitalgasse, published by a private publisher in 1850, the editor Franz Delitz writes that Weidmann’s original manuscript was rediscovered in a small archive. Delitz had been a close friend of the scribe and the spokesman for Weidmann’s unsuccessful operas in Vienna, and had published the first edition of his writings in 1782. Delitz found a second manuscript by chance, and asked the great Viennese writer Johann Caspar Lavater to provide a preface for the new edition of the book. Lavater, an ardent admirer of Goethe, said that the book was one of the “jewels” of literature, which deserved to be a member of the great classics.
The young physician in the baroque hospital gatehouse, who later became a physician of the Viennese plague hospital, was Antonin Smetana. Smetana was the son of a respected aristocratic and civil servant, who was the son of a court surgeon. Smetana was born in Vienna in 1722 and studied medicine in Vienna and Tübingen. He was a “Große Bundschussmann” – the highest military rank for the civil service – and the “wagon master”, the military police officer, in charge of the transportation of corpses from the plague hospital and the cemetery to the grave site. This latter role made him aware of the misery of the poor.
In 1761 he was appointed to the “new” general hospital. In 1767 he was asked to manage the plague hospital. He was responsible for the financial matters at the hospital, and he was also the doctor in charge of the mortuary and the entire hospital operation. He was also the most prominent doctor and writer in the baroque hospital. His interest in people was that they were dying of the plague, but the plague itself was no longer feared as it had been in the time of Mozart, who wrote the Don Giovanni opera during the plague epidemic of 1785.
The plague cemetery was no longer a cemetery, but was simply used as a place to bury the sick and the old people who were dying.
In the cemetery, there were still plague cemeteries, but in the cemetery there was a fire pit in which the plague-victims had been buried. In the burial pit there were also still the plague graves. In the cemetery there were now just the bodies of the dead, and the plague graves were no longer a plague cemetery.
This book is a masterpiece of journalism in the modern sense, but is nevertheless a masterpiece. It is a saga of 18th-century Vienna and its 18th-century poor people. It is also a time capsule of the period, a discovery of the book-form, a highly artistic document of the times in which it was written, an observation of human nature and a theatricalised representation of poverty and despair.
The author used a sober, classical text to tell stories, and described the plight of the “deficient poor”, i.e. those people who were unable to work. Weidmann described the suffering of the poor in the city and outside it, in monasteries and hospitals, and told of life in the countryside, where the poor were forced to beg and grovel. The poverty in Vienna, he said, was not because of the population density, but because of the level of poverty in the countryside.
In 1773 he became a physician in the new plague hospital, where he also took over the hospital as director. He was called the “Apostle” of Vienna, and he died in the Spital in 1816.
Spitalgasse is a book that will make you think about how poor people lived in Vienna, and the book’s purpose is to show the world that not only the poor, but also the rich, live under the fear of the plague.
It is also a work of art that is both masterful and entertaining. The whole of the book is a meditation on the lives of the poor, and the plight of the dead. The book is a great source of information about the time and place in which it was written, and is highly recommended.

The underground cave system was rumored to be home to the resting place of the pirate, Edward Kidd, who captured and brought to Barbados the first treasure galleon ship loaded with gold and silver from South America.
Although the cave system is closed, there are two relatively easy-to-reach cave systems. The Shallow Bay Cave System, located near River Bay is not difficult to enter, although not recommended if you are claustrophobic. The cave system includes the Black Hole, a cave so small that only one person can enter at a time.
Little Bay, a beach located just south of Bathsheba has access to cave formations that were originally blasted out of solid rock. After a short hike you can explore the caves.
You'll see the ruins of an old brick kiln, a reminder of the days when the area was a brickyard. The kiln is about 130 feet (40 meters) in diameter. The government owns the kiln, although it is crumbling into ruins. Because it was once home to marine iguanas, the area is called Marine Iguana Cave.
If you continue walking northward from the ruins, you'll pass by the remains of an old fishing trawler. It became stranded here in 1963. You can still see the mast rising above the surface. The coral reef has claimed the rest of the boat.
Look for big starfish in the shallow waters near the boat. You might see grouper fish and mackerel. There's a sandy beach at the base of the cave, and if you take a hike on the path just north of the kiln, you'll come to a natural pool. The crystal-clear water is perfect for a refreshing swim.
You can rent snorkel equipment, scuba gear, or pedal boats from the local tour operators. If you want to go snorkeling or swimming, you should not go alone. An experienced boat captain who knows the area can provide you with the best areas for snorkeling and swimming.
The park is also an important nesting ground for the green turtle. These turtles usually mate offshore, but when they are ready to lay their eggs, they come ashore.

A failed experiment in a high school science lab creates a portal to a dangerous new dimension.
While trying to give his family a wonderful holiday, Jonah discovers that he’s accidentally imported Krampus into the realm of the living.
A family moves into their new home in Oregon, only to find that it is haunted by the ghosts of murder victims.
Kevin heads back to the streets he’s missed so much after his father falls ill, only to discover that he’s been replaced by a robot double.
An obsessive fan of a murder mystery novel starts to believe that the events of the book are happening in his small community.

An unlikely friendship between a robot and a stray cat sparks an adventure involving robots and spaceships, Japanese anime style, in a children’s book written and illustrated by Chip Kidd and Erwin Milan, “Robot Dreams,” which is to be published by Penguin’s Dial Press in June.
The book’s titular dreams center on the exploits of two simple-looking robots, Z-Boy and Annie, who, rather than wander the Earth in pursuit of humans, spend their time hanging out with the cat.
Their escapades and the cat’s curiosity lead them to the shores of space in a celebration of the triumph of one’s imagination, as told through the Japanese art of expressing the fantastic through realistic and boldly inked illustrations.
Mr. Kidd, a designer and author, is a partner at the design and advertising firm Knopf and also an editor at Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Mr. Milan, an author and illustrator, is an author and illustrator.

Canine soldiers, like those seen here in St. James, are used in various capacities by military units.
Their lives are put on the line every day in ways that we can only imagine.
Making it to Canada is just the beginning for these military veterans
Canada has a lot of open doors and a wealth of opportunities. Not surprisingly, hundreds of soldiers have been heading north.
It’s a stereotype that many people come to Canada from Europe or Asia to escape the poverty that afflicts their home countries.
But an increasing number of people escaping to Canada have a much more specific goal in mind.
They want to start a new life after serving their country.
Canada is the second-largest recipient of people moving…

The commonalities of helping the homeless

Our family service project has raised over $5,000 and 4,000 pounds of food, mostly by donations from The Brick. The managers there told me this was one of the most successful fundraisers they have ever had.
I get asked by a lot of people why I am doing this, especially the younger people in my church who have no idea why I want to go to such lengths to help the less fortunate. But I always answer them the same way: I do it for my family.

The renowned chef's journey from humble beginnings to culinary mastery was a real journey, and he brings the reader along as he navigates and analyzes the hurdles he faced in establishing himself and sustaining his success.
Mistakes were made, but the chef doesn't hide them or get defensive, instead he owns them, and turns them into lessons learned.
There were a number of very interesting parts to this book, many of which I highlighted in my journal.
The chefs thoughts on food, cooking, and the food industry are unique and thought provoking.
When I first picked up this book, I thought I'd gain insights to "becoming a celebrity chef" and many of the tales of his rise to stardom were interesting.
However, he also gets into the business side of things which was eye opening.
I've always loved food, and I eat a varied diet, but I have never really focused on where the food comes from, and how it gets from farm to table.
Having grown up on a small farm, I thought I was quite familiar with the produce cycle, but I've never given any thought to the logistics of the meat business, or how fast food gets to the table.
Every step in the process of creating a meal and getting it to the customers is laid out clearly, and all the processes that take place to get a meal from idea to reality are exposed.
I've been cooking for myself, and friends for about a year, and it's been an enjoyable experience, but having so little knowledge of where food comes from, and how hard it is to get it to the table, I wasn't able to connect with my food.
The Culinary Institute of America may teach you the art of cooking, but they won't tell you about the entire industry, and this book is a good start.
I'll definitely read it again, and will recommend it to anyone interested in food, cooking, and the business of food.
Earlier this year I joined a book club (which happens to meet at a bar), and we picked a book together as a group (our first meeting).
I hadn't ever heard of this book, but the reviews on Amazon were overwhelmingly positive, so I figured I'd give it a try.
The premise of the book is this; you're on an island, and it's you, three girls, and a man who you don't know (but who you know is part of a cult) running from a tiger.
What you don't know is that this man is the one who took you and the girls to the island, where you are being hunted by a tiger.
You are all wearing oxygen masks, and in order to get to the beach, and be rescued, you must remove the masks and walk through the jungle.
I think this book was good for a few reasons, and there's a few characters I still don't really understand.
There's a character that shows up in the book very briefly, and then they are never mentioned again, so their purpose in the book is unclear.
The whole ending is a little confusing. I think it's supposed to be a twist, but it wasn't really that much of a surprise, I don't know if the ending was meant to leave you confused, but I wasn't really that confused.
The final chapters were pretty weak, in my opinion.
I gave this book four stars. I thought it was an interesting concept, and the writing was really good, but some parts just didn't make sense, and a few characters weren't really used as much as I thought they would be.
If you like "end of the world" stories, you'll probably enjoy this book, and I'm sure the ending makes more sense if you read the book in a group.
This is a great book for anyone who enjoys a well written horror/mystery novel.
You don't need to know anything about Game of Thrones to read this book.
The very beginning of this novel is an excerpt from the chapter 'Red Keep', from 'A Game of Thrones'.
It's kind of a neat way to introduce the reader to the world, but it's very confusing, and you don't get any other information about the characters or the world.
The story is about a boy and his sister, and their adventures trying to get back home from an alternate world.
I thought the book started out strong, and had some great imagery, and some interesting characters, but it fell apart after the middle of the book.
The ending was disappointing, and kind of rushed, and it didn't really explain any of the mysteries that I was really interested in.
I'm interested in seeing what happens to these characters in the next book, and I'd still recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story, but doesn't have a lot of time to read it.
I read this book while I was on vacation, and it was perfect for that.
The story follows the journey of a group of teenagers as they travel the country with the band "The Shining".
They're not really all that interested in the band, but they're not really allowed to do anything else.
The book is really short, and it's more about the journey than the story, but I thought the author did a great job of telling the story.
There's a lot of great imagery, and I really liked the fact that the characters were all different people.
It's a fun book to read on the plane or in the car, and I think it's a great introduction to some great authors and their works.
The author does a great job of making you feel like you're there.
I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes the 'young adult' genre, and to anyone who wants a quick and easy read.
I was recommended this book by a friend, and I'm really glad I did.
The book follows the journey of a group of teenagers, who are all trying to get to the beach.
I thought it was a great read. The book is really short, and I was able to finish it in about two hours.
I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story.
The characters are really well written, and the author does a great job of telling the story.
The only thing I didn't like about the book was the ending.
The ending was a little disappointing, and I didn't really understand why they all left the island.
I would definitely read this book again.
This book was a lot better than I expected.
I thought the beginning was a little slow, and I didn't really like how the book was written, but once you get into it, it's really well written.
I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a horror novel, but I thought it was really well written.
I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes horror novels, or just wants a good story.
I've been reading this book on and off for the past few months, and I'm really glad I finally finished it.
I thought this book was really good.
It's really well written, and it's really fun to read.
I think this book is a good introduction to horror novels, and it's a great way to get introduced to some new authors.
I'm not sure if I'll read this book again, but I'm really glad I read it once.
This book was a lot better than I expected. I thought the beginning was a little slow, and I didn't really like how the book was written, but once you get into it, it's really well written.

I think this book is a good introduction to horror novels, and it's a great way to get introduced to some new authors.
This book was not what I expected. I have read The Hunger Games series, but not the first book in this series. I was looking for something that was a little different. I was not disappointed.
The story starts with a man who has just left his wife and daughter and is returning to his home town. He has been gone for some time, and when he arrives, he finds that his home town has changed.
His wife and daughter are both there, but they have changed. They are both a little different.
The story is about the changes in the family, and how they cope with the changes.
I really enjoyed this book. It was very easy to read, and I was able to finish it in a few days. I really liked the characters, and I thought that the story was really well written. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story.
I read this book after seeing a movie based on it. I enjoyed the movie, and thought it would be interesting to see how the book compared.
The book is much better than the movie, and I think that is because it is written from the perspective of the main character, R

When the Time Comes, you will find us.
Aliens abound in our Universe. They are everywhere, just too tiny to see. They can be seen with electron microscopes, seen with Hubble Telescopes, seen with satellites, and seen with space telescopes. Some scientists believe that they can be seen with a mild telescope as well, with the proper filters.
I believe it is possible that, since science has shown us that many worlds are just tiny and invisible to us, that our ancient ancestors would have been able to see them, and interpret what they were seeing, in the traditional mythology. And perhaps it is even possible that our own early ancestors may have been among those ancient aliens.
The Star People,
The Alien Planet.
Somewhere out there in space, there is a planet, a planet where humanity has never been. It is also true that humanity was never invited to it. For the Space Aliens, it was a shocking discovery to be made. These beings from another world, not so very distant, were to learn that they were being excluded from their own destiny. But for us, we are excluded from our own destiny as well.
The Lost City,
Among the Stars, a Message from an ancient Civilization, telling the humans to leave, is received. Don't listen, warn the Elders. They are insane, say the Sci Fi. We are a way of life, say the humans. It's not that simple.
The Fallen City of the Aliens,
The Humans will not listen. We leave the stars, tell the aliens, but this is our world. We are part of the Universe. Our humanity will not be defeated by the aliens, the Elders say.
The Unknown World,
Nothing is quite as vast as the oceans.
What did we see, we ask ourselves.
Did we hear the message? Did we see the stars?
Did we see the angel? Did we see the alien?
A Single Night,
The people lived in a village that was not very large. They were farmers. They had no other choice but to stay and do as they were taught. So, they lived in fear. It was a terrible fear, as they waited for the invasion. Then, one night, when the fires had not yet been lit for the new year, someone came.
The Invasion,
We are a way of life, we humans tell the aliens. It is not so simple. The aliens were not content with the idea that the Earth was theirs to claim. They decided to destroy all life on Earth. And they did. But the humans have been given a gift. A gift to save the Earth.
Somewhere out there in space, there is a planet, a planet where humanity has never been. It is also true that humanity was never invited to it. But for us, we are excluded from our own destiny as well.
The Unearthed Planet,
It was a massive rock in the heavens. It was gigantic. The size of the planet was overwhelming. The rock was a black mass, black and shiny. But it was not the size of the planet that would be a problem. It was the size of the planet that would be a problem.
The UFO,
For years, people had talked about UFOs. But it was only now that it was actually possible to see the truth. In the sky, they saw a black mass that was both dark and bright. It was a UFO.
The Contact,
It happened on a night. There was a sky full of stars. The only light on the Earth was the moon. And that was not enough. But, there was one more star in the sky. That one star was bright.
The Knowledge,
If Humanity isn't listening, then who is?
So, what is it that we're looking for? What is it that we are looking for?
If Humanity is listening, then what is it that we're looking for? What is it that we are looking for?
If Humanity isn't listening, then what is it that we're looking for? What is it that we are looking for?
If Humanity isn't listening, then what is it that we're looking for? What is it that we are looking for? The aliens are here, they say. The aliens are here, we say. The aliens are here, we say. The aliens are here, they say.
The Human War,
The people were fighting for their lives. They fought bravely, and died bravely. But the aliens were determined to win. They had no time to waste. They were already attacking their people. They had been preparing for this moment for a long time. They were ready for it.
The Alien Invaders,
The humans were not invited to the city. They did not have permission to be there. But they were. They had not left the city. They had not left the planet. They were still here, and they were in danger.
The Lost City of the Aliens,
The humans will not listen. We leave the stars, tell the aliens, but this is our world. We are part of the Universe. Our humanity will not be defeated by the aliens, the Elders say. But we are not defeated. We are still here.
What did we see, we ask ourselves. Did we hear the message? Did we see the stars? Did we see the angel? Did we see the alien? We do not know. We are not sure. We only know that we are here, and we are still alive.

A Poison in the Blood
Under the Water Towers
Fabien Debrauwer

The abandoned theater on the hill whispered secrets of its past life as it sat in a heap of its brick and wood, spread out over the road like a heap of uncounted bodies from one war or another.
He picked his way around the piles of bricks, squeezed between them. He could see into the seats, all the empty seats. It was as if every seat held the body of someone who'd been ready to leave, and were just waiting to be told. He was one of them.
He made his way up the aisle, up to the stage, and sat in the front row. The seat felt unnatural in this place where seats had been shattered and scattered, missing, some blackened by fire. But there was something about it, too. As if someone had sat there in this very place, right here, and left a mark. He sat down, and watched the motionless figures on the stage.
The burnt-out husk of the organ was just to the right of the stage, sitting hunched as if cringing from a head that knew too many secrets.
There was a door in the left wall of the stage that led to the catacombs underneath the theater. The structure, if you could call it that, was missing its top floor, in which were the seats.
His grandfather had once told him of the night he came here to watch the showing of a movie called The Grapes of Wrath. After it, they'd all gone to a restaurant on the other side of the island, and talked about what they'd seen, and the fact that the theater was going to close down. They'd talked about how, like everything, it would go, fall away to dust and rust and rot.
He was supposed to come with him that night.
His grandfather had been an old man by then, old enough that his days were numbered, too. He had come to the theater to be with his friends, and to be close to the place that meant so much to them. That night they'd talked about everything, as they always had when they were alone together. The talk had been cheerful and depressed at the same time, because he'd known it was his last chance. He'd had a son, but he'd never talked to him, never seen him, except as a picture.
But it was his son that he was most ashamed of, because he'd never told him that the boy was his. He wasn't sure that telling him would have made any difference. But still, he should have done it.
He remembered the little boy playing with his toy truck at the edge of the hill, as he talked to his friends, and then his father came over to him, crouched down to his level, looked into his eyes, and spoke.
The boy had understood everything. He'd felt the pull of that story, and wanted to be a part of it. So he'd squeezed his grandfather's hand and said, "Let's go."
And the next day, his father had come to the restaurant to look for him, and when he saw the boy he told his friends, "You keep him, he's mine."
And they'd taken the boy, and that was the last he ever saw of him. The last his father ever saw of him. The last anyone ever saw of him.
He'd always loved the theater, always wanted to be close to it. Like a beautiful girl who wakes up one morning and knows that she's going to be someone someday. That she's going to rise above everyone else, be someone, and do things no one else has done, and no one will ever do again.
That feeling, he thought, might be what had brought him here to this place. Or maybe not. There were a lot of things it might have been. He'd felt the same way about the old downtown that had stood along the waterfront, where the tracks had run alongside the edge of the cliffs, where the buildings had stretched away for miles, then come to the ends of the island, where the old land once ran up and the modern land began, the low green hills that looked like waves cresting in the ocean, the trees that grew on them like seaweed along the shore.
He'd never told his grandfather about his dreams of the theater, or of the city along the waterfront, or of the lives that had once lived and been here, and were now gone. But still, maybe that was what he'd felt when he'd come to the theater that last time, that feeling that the place was waiting for him, that he would come here and talk to the people in it, and somehow he would be able to ask them if they'd ever known his grandfather, or if they knew the boy who had lived on the edge of the cliff.
And maybe they had told him, maybe the spirits of those who had come here had seen him, and shared the story with him, and showed him that he was a part of that story.
The theater whispered and spoke, and he knew it was waiting for him, and something deep within his mind, something he didn't want to hear, told him it was waiting for him to tell the story of the boy.
The theater spoke to him, and told him that he was the one. The one who would tell the story of the boy who became a man, and the story of the man who looked into the eyes of the boy and saw his own future.
The child's eyes had been dark as a cloud, but the man's were like shining snow in the moonlight. And the man had been frightened, and the child, and had been a gift, because he had seen what the man would be, and he had known that when the man became that, the man would forget his fears and sorrow, and would become the boy he was.
And when the boy became a man, he had the chance to see the past, and to know what was going to be. He could see into the future, and knew he would come here one day, and tell the story of the boy who became a man. He would see that time, the boy's time, was still here. And he would understand what it meant.
And he'd heard this story from the theater, and from the boy who became a man, who was telling him what had happened, but couldn't be told until the story was finished. And he'd known that he would be the one, the one who would come back, and finish the story.
He would sit here and wait, and when the theater finally fell down he'd come back to see it. And he'd know that it was safe to tell the story, that the boy who became a man, and then a boy again, was done with his future, and could be told the story of the boy who became a man.
This time he would be the one, because the boy was already done with his future, and it was safe to tell the story.
He leaned back, stretched out his legs, and let his head roll back. He closed his eyes, and dreamed of the boy, and the boy who became a man, and the man who became the boy, and he was the boy, the one who would tell the story of the boy who became a man.
The theater spoke to him, and the boy spoke to him, and told him that when he was ready, he'd come back to the theater, and there would be a story that he could tell.
And that was where he'd wait, until the theater fell down.
# THE GIRL WHO WENT AWAY
She was a regular customer. She had come into the store twice a week for the past four weeks, and had always asked the same question, "Is it ready yet?"
She was a nice old lady, looked to be about sixty years old. She wore a plain blue cotton dress that fell to the floor. Her brown hair was pulled back in a tight bun. She was looking at the jacket I had in the display case.
I knew what she wanted, because she had asked the same question twice a week. She'd asked it like she expected me to know.
She must have seen the workbench and the tools. It didn't take much to put it together.
The leather jacket had been a flop, but this one was going to be a classic. I'd used the leather from an old horse harness I'd found in a trunk in my grandfather's attic. It was soft and worn-looking, but there was something about it that spoke of a past that was gone. It was like watching a television show where the characters don't know they're on TV.
I'd cut out a pattern and sewn it together. I'd been thinking about what she wanted it for, and I figured it was for her grandson, or some young kid who was into motorcycles and wanted a jacket like a biker would wear. I hadn't had much experience with leather jackets, but I figured that a girl who rode motorcycles would like a jacket like this one.
I looked down at the jacket in the case, and smiled. It was done. All that was left was a bit of hand

A chance encounter on a train journey leads to an unexpected adventure involving the wonderful 3D animation style of Pixar. There is nothing so magical as the first time you experience animation as a director (so far). This is my fourth time working with Pixar and the third in which I’ve been asked to create a short for them, and the experience always feels so surreal. It always feels a bit like a magic trick and there is never a moment when you completely believe it is real.
Working with Pixar is always an incredible experience, and they are always looking for different ways of telling stories, and different ways of creating the feeling of film making (as with how they create ‘depth’ in their animation with their stereoscopic 3D). This time I was asked to see if there was a way I could make it feel like a live action film.
The whole process was a huge journey and definitely pushed me to think in a different way and challenge myself as a director.

The first blooms of spring in the garden signal the beginning of a long awaited season of colour. The days that follow the arrival of flowers are usually some of the best of the season as they dance a brisk dance with the warm spring sun. Spring is a time of transition in many ways. For years we wait in anticipation for this season, and the change from winter to spring is one of those moments we savour. In this ephemeral moment, we find nature's secret to a happy garden.
When we first see the early spring flowers in the garden, we are filled with delight. Often, it is the first sign of spring, but often spring follows the joy of these flowers with another sneaky step into winter's grasp. The weeds and grasses in the garden start their growth anew, and even though the summer blooms are still to come, the garden will soon be overtaken by competing growth. If you wait too long, you will lose the spring flowers to weeds.
Every gardener has had the joyous experience of hearing the jubilant singing of robins, chipmunks and other signs of spring. This year in particular, the song birds have been in amazing abundance and many have taken up residence in the very shrubs and trees we are trying to protect in the garden. We joke about our snowbirds migrating to warmer climes, but the truth is the snowbirds we find in our gardens are also migrating, searching for a new environment and building their nests.
Spring is a busy time in the garden and winter is just leaving the room. The gardeners time is a very busy time, filled with the desire to catch up with all that has been neglected for the long winter months. Often spring also brings extra activities into the garden, such as community workshops and special events, where the garden becomes a place of community gathering.
The greatest thing about spring in the garden is that, for a brief moment, the garden is in the best condition it will be all year long. The flowers bloom, the weeds are very few and the growth is just starting. As a gardener you have the experience of seeing it all happen, the weeds withering away, the flowers blooming, and the garden is at its best. These days of celebration are always short lived, but as the plants mature and the weeds and other nasties take hold, these moments of joyous harmony become something that keeps us dreaming of what is to come.

A misdelivered package contains a gadget from the future, which could end all the wars in the world. It changes the way we are now. We should stop fighting each other, which means the following chain reaction:
* No war - no need for weapons - no weapons factories
* No weapons factories - no need for soldiers - no armies
* No armies - no need for rules of combat - no need for lawyers
* No lawyers - no need for law - no lawyers
* No lawyers - no need for courts - no need for judges

An amateur detective stumbles upon a case involving missing socks and discovers that some missing items are not what they seem. Traveling through New York City, Bermuda, and Cuba, Gabe Perlmutter finds himself at the center of a web of intrigue involving the mafia, a professor named Olaf, and a plot to put a fish on the moon. A series of amusing coincidences lead Gabe to help two women — one a professor and one a gangster’s moll — and their attempts to find their missing socks.

The discovery of a rare species in the Amazon rainforest opens up discussions about the validity of the current extinction risk assessments. The extinction risk assessment, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, is one of the main tools used by conservationists to determine which species require urgent protection measures. But does it work? The discovery of a previously unknown lizard in Brazil suggests that it is not that reliable.
Draculaan lizards are a genus endemic to Brazil. The genus has only two species, both of which are critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. One of these species is almost endemic to just a single area of forest; the other species to a larger but still very restricted area of the same forest. These lizards, which weigh less than a pound and grow to be about 10 inches long, are the only lizard genus of its kind in the world.
A collection of the critically endangered lizards was stolen from the wild in 1993.
Until recently, though, this genus seemed to consist of just these two species. Then, however, scientists discovered an entirely new species while researching a mysterious set of fossils from the coast of Rio de Janeiro. These fossils, now thought to be around 110 million years old, were a very similar to the living lizards, indicating that they are an early species of the genus. This discovery has made a lot of people sit up and take notice, as it means that the conservation status of the species was erroneous and the real status of the lizard genus is more complex than previously thought.
A mature male lizard in the wild.
At present, the genus is believed to have become extinct during the Pleistocene extinction. But that might not be the case. The lizards are not just restricted to the Brazilian rainforest but also appear to live further north in Venezuela. This discovery has made conservationists question the validity of the current statuses of the other members of the genus as well, as other species of the genus could be present in the North as well. To add to this, there are even more lizard species in the rainforest than currently believed.
Scientists are eager to uncover what is going on in the rainforest. There are several species of lizard yet to be described, some of which could be new to science. As there is also a massive amount of diversity in the area, which is the result of the human-driven rainforest fragmentation, it is believed that more species are going to be found. This is the reason that the extinction risk assessment of the new species has been described as “outdated and inaccurate.”
Scientists hope to uncover even more species of lizard.
Researchers are also curious to see what happened to the population of the lizards when the forests in the area were logged in the 1970s. It is still not completely understood how and when these lizards became critically endangered and how their populations came to be so small and restricted. This is not a process that can easily be replicated, and it could reveal a lot about how forests can recover.

A breakthrough in renewable energy presents solutions to long-standing problems of how to deal with nuclear waste, while providing an easy and sustainable solution to global energy demands.
New H2A Reset breaks down nuclear waste into its harmless elements
A new breakthrough in fusion technology has developed the H2A Reset, which can quickly and efficiently break down nuclear waste into its harmless elements of hydrogen and helium, reducing the decay time of nuclear waste down to a fraction of its current life span.
The H2A Reset is a portable and compact fusion reactor which can decompose nuclear waste into its harmless elements, thereby addressing problems of prolonged radioactive decay times in nuclear waste. Additionally, the energy produced by the H2A Reset can be used to produce abundant quantities of hydrogen for energy production and other uses.
The H2A Reset is a fusion reactor which consists of a compact cylindrical container, encased in a spherical shell, with a volume of only 1.2 cubic metres. The system is entirely mobile and can be towed into position within a small space, enabling it to be easily set up at any location in the world. It has a minimal electrical power requirement of only 2MW.
The H2A Reset is currently undergoing testing in Moscow, with a completion date set for 2022.
Once the H2A Reset is up and running, it will provide a sustainable, long-term solution for reducing the radioactive decay time of nuclear waste and producing abundant amounts of energy. This would help to alleviate the threat of nuclear waste, while also providing a reliable source of energy for the future.
A solution to two problems: nuclear waste and sustainable energy
By addressing the problems of nuclear waste disposal and the search for sustainable energy sources, the H2A Reset has the potential to be a revolutionary breakthrough in renewable energy. With its compact size, portability and minimal power requirements, it could provide an easily accessible and long-term solution to nuclear waste problems, as well as a reliable source of energy for the future.
The Russian Ministry of Defence is currently carrying out trials on the H2A Reset. Once the trials are completed, it will be put into service and could potentially revolutionise the energy industry, providing a sustainable and reliable solution for both nuclear waste disposal and energy production.
In the current time of uncertainty in the energy sector, the H2A Reset presents a viable, long-term solution which could provide a reliable source of energy for generations to come. With its ability to break down nuclear waste into harmless elements, the H2A Reset has the potential to revolutionise the energy industry, providing a sustainable and reliable solution for the future.
Nuclear waste Nuclear waste is the residue left behind after nuclear reactions have taken place, usually in the form of radioactive material. This waste can be divided into two types: low-level waste, which is mainly the waste produced in hospitals and industry, and high-level waste, which is the waste from nuclear power plants and other nuclear installations. Both types of waste are hazardous, but high-level waste is much more so, as it contains radioactive elements such as plutonium and uranium, which have extremely long half-lives. High-level waste has a long half-life and must be stored in a safe, secure way for thousands of years to come, making nuclear waste disposal one of the biggest challenges facing the nuclear industry.
How long does nuclear waste last?
The half-life of nuclear waste is the time taken for it to decay to half of its original value, and it varies according to the type of radioactive element present. High-level waste can have half-lives of up to tens of thousands of years, which means it must be stored for thousands of years to come. Low-level waste, on the other hand, decays much faster, and it has a half-life of less than 1000 years. However, the half-life of nuclear waste still remains a big challenge for nuclear disposal.
What are the problems associated with nuclear waste disposal?
The storage of high-level nuclear waste is a complex and expensive process, as it requires special facilities and strict safety protocols. The location of these facilities is also a source of contention, as some people are concerned about the potential for accidents or leaks in the future. In addition, the large quantities of nuclear waste can present a significant environmental hazard, as some radioactive elements can leach into the soil and groundwater, potentially causing harm to wildlife and humans in the area.

The gentle waves at the beach at sunset inspire a painter to capture the sun on his canvas. One evening, a tender-hearted street dog, enjoys the sunset too, so he paints an empty canvas with the sun's reflection. His painting is so beautiful that it looks real. When other dogs come by, they ask to buy it. One by one, they purchase the painting, yet the painting stays the same. Then the kind-hearted painter decides to give the painting to the street dogs. They take the painting home and each one of them puts it on their wall. As time passes by, the canvas gets old and worn out.
After that incident, the dogs enjoy sunsets at the beach and they start thinking about their first painting. The painter can see that they are all happy and smiling. At that moment, the painter understands that art is not about the canvas, but the joy it brings to someone's life.
One of the best children books of all time.

A book club for superheroes becomes contentious when they can't agree on what they think about the latest entry in the Bat-family, Detective Comics #886.
Just like I'm bringing to the table for this month, this is an old school Batman comic featuring one of the holy trinity in the Bat-family, with a team-up with a beloved supporting character who is un- or underutilized by his current home.
I have something to say about this comic that I think is going to be a lot more controversial than I originally thought. I think the problem I have with it is going to be more than the premise (Team-ups always seem to get cut too short) or a single scene or two (which I do also have a problem with). I think I have an issue with the message this comic is sending.
I'm going to spoil the comic up to where the Joker has revealed his identity to both the book club and the reader. If you want to wait until you read it, go buy it and you can see it for yourself. Just to keep you out of your spoilerphobia, I'm going to say that we don't even see the book club at the end of the issue. Just be forewarned that I'm about to give away a great deal about the plot.
Here's the premise: Batman is invited to participate in a book club made up of some of his most famous adversaries. He declines at first, but decides to go anyway when Catwoman (for a total of 5 women at this point) points out that it would be a good way to get a jump on the villains he's going to face next time he gets his back-up guys together to beat the crap out of him. There are only a few rules. One, they're not allowed to talk about what they're reading while they're reading it. They're allowed to talk about it after they finish. Two, they're not allowed to talk about who Batman is while Batman is there (I assume that's to protect the secret identities of the Riddler and Two-Face, who we are allowed to know the identities of while Batman is there). The third is, "There is no Batman."
So, in this context, I'm going to break one of the rules: I'm going to talk about the characters before the event that will change the book club forever. The reason why I'm going to be talking about the book before the event is because I think it is so much more than just the reason why the book club is revealed to have a problem. I think it plays a part in what changes the book club in the end.
The Riddler: Ed Nygma's book is a book called "Confessions of a Creeper" by Catwoman. In it, she confesses to everything that Nygma knows about Batman. It has pictures, logos, equipment used, habits, quirks, etc. Everything that he knows. That means Nygma knows his identity. He knows the identities of the whole team (which I do think is a good way to avoiding disclosing the identity of Batman to anyone who isn't already in the know, even if it is only for the length of the conversation in the book club). However, Nygma was already getting a little crazy. When he thinks that Batman is Two-Face, he locks Batman into a room with someone he assumes to be his friend. When he finds out it's Two-Face's boss instead, he locks him in the same room instead.
This is a little different. You see, Nygma is already on a quest to make people fall in love with him, and, like the Joker, he needs an audience. Like the Joker, he wants to be loved because he's sick and twisted, but he doesn't want the audience to see that sick and twisted side of him. If you read through his exploits in this comic, you'll notice that every attempt he makes is at the moment being recorded for posterity by someone. A billionaire giving a ghost tour of Wayne Manor with the Riddler at his side. The Riddler making a deal with a Joker who has no objection to the deal because he wants the media. The Riddler's inability to get a date, even when there are two women available to him. Everything the Riddler tries to do is to get people to love him (or be his friends or give him an audience or an opportunity to do whatever he wants), and yet he needs to be obscured from view. He wants to be the joke, but at the same time he doesn't want anyone to see him. There's a bit of a contradiction there. In this, he's taken it to a whole new level, because he can give the people he wants to love him what they want in the form of the secret identity of Batman.
I was always a little wary of Riddler. I thought he was supposed to be a bit smarter than he turned out to be. In this, I see why he's smarter. The fact that he can keep his obsession and sickness in control and keep the Joker in control at the same time makes him the most dangerous Batman villain of all time.
Two-Face: At the beginning of the comic, we're already getting a sense of how he's going to develop. He's either a big fan of Batman or a big enemy of Batman. He's only been getting one side of the story and wants both sides so that he can form his own opinion. This is an interesting take on Two-Face. One of the villains we see as a monster who has lost all sense of right and wrong but has a code that he tries to follow with people who can convince him that they're right. However, Two-Face has gotten even more crazy.
Now, Two-Face is not only a fan or an enemy. He wants to be the judge of Batman. However, when we are introduced to him, he's not doing it out of a crazy desire to take things into his own hands. He's doing it to have an audience and be loved. He doesn't like being one half of Two-Face. He wants to be the whole Two-Face. If he thinks Batman is a hero and Catwoman is a hero, then he's not going to be able to be Two-Face if the heroes are heroes and villains are villains.
The Riddler sees the obvious solution to this: give everyone what they want by giving everyone what they don't want. He has the power to reveal the identity of Batman and he's willing to use that power for the sake of popularity, and the stupidity of the other members of the book club gives him that power.
Harvey Bullock: I'm not as crazy about Harvey Bullock as I used to be. I think that his decision to let Riddler in is because he's afraid of Riddler (and I think that I'm not going to be surprised if Harvey Bullock turns out to be the Riddler's twin). The decision to let Catwoman in is because he has romantic feelings for Catwoman.
I do think that there's a part of Harvey Bullock who wants Batman to go down. This is probably where I'm the most against this comic because I think that the takeaway is that Batman is getting too obsessed with a rogue's gallery that's becoming more and more dangerous. Harvey Bullock thinks that's a good thing. If the guy you're up against isn't getting stronger, he doesn't have to be that strong himself to beat him. If Batman isn't getting stronger, he can rest easy and rest easier. Harvey Bullock's character arc ends with him shooting Riddler and trying to bring him in.
This is probably where I'm the most against this comic. Batman is doing this because he thinks it's for the best, but I don't think it's for the best. I don't think it's for the betterment of Gotham or even the betterment of Harvey Bullock. I think Harvey Bullock is acting on his own self-interest, which means that if he's shooting at Riddler, he's shooting at Batman as well. In the next issue, we're going to see a lot of how Batman, Catwoman, and Two-Face react to Harvey Bullock's attempt at stopping the Riddler. However, I have a bad feeling that Harvey Bullock is going to die. I think that's the reason why I hate this comic so much.
The Joker: This is where I get more critical of the comic. The Joker is a womanizer, a professional gambler, a prankster, and a master criminal. His plan is to find the most useless people in Gotham and get them to be his own gang, led by a powerful moll. The reason why he's so confident is because he's already had the power of the Bat-family to himself.
Now, Batman, Cat

"Dragons are the natural enemy of Vikings"
“Dragons are the natural enemy of Vikings. We eat them. They eat us.”

An interstellar cruise ship offers tours to exotic planets, including one where humans can actually change their sex! The catch is they have to remain celibate during the tour. The cruise lines compete fiercely for customers, and to survive, a cruise ship captain (Pullman) decides to accept his passengers' demands to re-examine the rule, which he knows violates an important principle. This was inspired by the Elgin Marbles, British statues which were removed from their original home in Greece and placed in the British Museum.

The creation of a virtual reality world offers experiences beyond the imagination, including immersive music.
Using VR headsets, wearers enter into a three-dimensional world, where their visual and auditory sense engage with an environment created with computer-generated graphics.
VR headsets and music were released to the market in 2014, creating a massive opportunity for new ways to enjoy musical experiences. The HTC Vive VR headset, for example, promises a new experience for music lovers.
Music in VR
A VR music experience is immersive and transporting. However, the feeling of being in a different world doesn’t completely lend itself to a musical experience. Audiences want the feeling of concerts, where they hear sounds and feel the beat of the music through their feet.
A collaboration between SONY and HTC Vive has created a musical experience that allows users to listen and dance to music, and experience the sensations of being in a live concert. The SONY song, “Fly Away Holiday,” released in October 2014, brings a fusion of funk, disco, and pop to VR. The song was initially released in a special concert, with different dance scenes for the audience to experience through virtual reality.
Another VR music experience is by the music video game creator Rhythm Doctor, which released “Mutant Bass,” a virtual reality-only experience. “Mutant Bass” takes players into a new type of game where you wear your headset and use your hands to control two robots, mashing buttons to react to different rhythms and rhymes.
The Future of VR Music
While there are new ways to experience music with VR, it is just as new and experimental. While these experiences are fun, they’re still relatively basic and not too much different from other music experiences. However, as the technology continues to evolve, new ways to experience music with VR are sure to be released.
